        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">Diego Rivera and Frida Kahlo’s marriage was tumultuous at best. Frida created this painting during a particularly low point in their marriage. Rivera was having an affair with the movie star Maria Felix, and he was rumored to ask her to marry hum. Although both of them had extramarital affairs, this one was particularly painful, as illustrated by this painting. Many times, Kahlo was able to laugh at Rivera’s indiscretions, but this painting shows real pain and suffering. She once referred to two accidents in her life; one of them being the streetcar accident, the other being Diego Rivera. </span>

Watching the moon as a destination is a suggested exit strategy to escape from the ghetto and from a world in which no trip can bring you far from slavery. During the construction of the work, the immigrants proposed to put the work on top of the factory tower so that the telescope could be visible from the entire neighborhood. In this way, they elected this work of art as a monument, a symbol of their existence in a territory that tried not to see them, and a declaration of the right to dream to be free.<br><br>(Metropoliz, former Fiorucci.

        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">The Pink Dress is an 1864 painting by <a target="_blank" href="/en/frederic-bazille">Frédéric Bazille</a>, produced when he was aged 23. It shows his cousin Thérèse des Hours sitting on the stone ledge around the family property of Le Domaine de Méric in Montpellier, facing the village of Castelnau-le-Lez in the Hérault department of France. He used the <a target="_blank" href="/en/artists-by-painting-school/barbizon-school">Barbizon School</a>'s method of framing the scene, using dark trees to direct the viewer's eye to the bright light in the background. The work is now in the Musée d'Orsay.<br>

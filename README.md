        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">Kusama’s Infinity Mirror Room, a large scale mirrored installation was part of her solo exhibition “Floor Show” which opened at the Castellane Gallery, New York in November 1965.
<br>
<br>The floor of the mirror-lined room was lined in white phallic blobs covered in red polka dots. Kusama posed placid on the floor in a red body suit. The seemingly endless, dotted environment was a reflection of the artist’s psychological state, her experience of acute depression and personal observations of the repetitiveness of daily life. Kusama coined the term Obsessional Art to describe her work.</span>

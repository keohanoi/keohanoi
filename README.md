        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">Venus and Adonis is a painting by the Italian late Mannerist artist <a target="_blank" href="/en/paolo-veronese">Paolo Veronese</a>, executed in 1580, now in the Museo del Prado in Madrid.
<br>
<br>The original painting was enlarged in the upper border in the 18th century. This added section was removed in a restoration (c. 1988) so the work recovered the horizontal format.
<br>
<br>The painting's subject is taken from Ovid. It portrays the hunter Adonis sleeping in Venus' lap. In front of her is Eros, with a sighthound. Cupid is portrayed while trying to quench the dog's desire to hunt, as Venus had forecast that Adonis would die during a hunt. In the background is a lively landscape, with a green- and blueshaded sky.
<br>
<br>The Prado also has a Venus and Adonis by Titian.</span>

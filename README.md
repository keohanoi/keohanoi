        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">Kandinsky’s On White II expresses an intelligent combination of the two main colors in the painting: black and white. Kandinsky used color to represent more than just shapes and figures in his paintings. In this painting the many dimensions of the color white is used to represent the many possibilities and opportunities available in life. The color black, on the other hand, represents non-existence and death. Kandinsky expressed the color black as the silence of death, and in this painting, the black cuts through the white background with a riotous effect, shattering the peace of the colorful combination of colors, or as it were, opportunities in life.</span>

        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">The work "Hunting scene with a view of the Black Sea" is painted according to the monotype by Hungarian painter. Niko only changed the background. Instead of pine-tree forest, he painted Georgian one, which resembles the forest represented on "The feast". I discovered the reproduction of this monotype in the magazine at Bokuchava family, in Didube district (Tbilisi). I shoot it and the photo is held by me.</span>

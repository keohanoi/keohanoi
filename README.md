      <p class="description">
        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">Almaraz was a pioneering <a target="_blank" href="https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/chicano-art-movement">Chicano</a> artist who produced art for the United Farm Workers Union and cofounded <a target="_blank" href="https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-painting-school/los-four">Los Four</a>, one of the earliest Chicano collectives. A later shift to expressionistic painting and graphics brought him national recognition. By the 1980s, his non-narrative images of Los Angeles addressed both his cultural affiliations and sense of isolation with living with AIDS. <i>Night Magic (Blue Jester)</i>, inspired by velvet paintings sold on the U.S.-Mexico border, represents urban Los Angeles exploding with sensuous colors and populated by shadows suggestive of Almaraz’s lonely alter egos.</span>

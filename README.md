This also showed the picture to have been painted on the back of a printed advertisement for an exhibition of the St. Ives Society of Artists at the Porthmeor Gallery, in which seven members and associates of the Royal Academy, among ‘other leading artists of the St Ives Colony’, are listed by name.</span>

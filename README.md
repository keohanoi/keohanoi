        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">The artist said that this picture was not painted in Provence, but in his studio in Paris. He often visits Provence, is very responsive to the light of that region and finds the Provençal landscape stimulating to his imagination. 'Provence I' 1957 belongs to a series of paintings associated with Provence which he began in 1957 and proposed to continue in 1958 and the following year. The blue is not intended to represent the blue of the Mediterranean, but instead serves him to transform and recall the total impression of the landscape in Mediterranean light. It is also the throbbing, the vibration of that light. He set out to convey the feeling of being in the landscape and surrounded by it, instead of just being a spectator looking at it. </span>

        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">Untitled #126 is a colour photograph in which the artist appears, costumed and made up, posing with one foot up on a cane chair. It belongs to one of four groups of photographs relating to fashion photography that Sherman produced between 1983 and 1994. The first group, into which Untitled #126 falls, was commissioned by American retail entrepreneur Diane Benson for a spread in Interview magazine. She supplied Sherman with clothes by such top-of-the-range international designers as Jean-Paul Gaultier and Comme des Garçons. In the same year the French fashion house Dorothée Bis offered their own clothes for a series to appear in French Vogue. The images Sherman created for these two ‘fashion shoots’ are the antithesis of the glamorous world of fashion. The model in the photographs appears silly, angry, dejected, exhausted, abused, scarred, grimy and psychologically disturbed. </span>

        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">‘Study for an assassination’, refers to the ‘mother of all conspiracy theories’: the JFK shooting. For the painting, the artist has disassembled the iconic Zapruder footage and transported the scene to a film set where the logical coherence has been removed. In the foreground, Jacky Kennedy can be seen as she was reaching for something on the boot of the limousine. In the background is the infamous ‘umbrella man’ whose involvement in the murder has since been debunked. (Or has it…?)</span>

        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe"><i>Sleeping Girl</i> refers to the early period of Sonia Delaunay. The famous abstract artist started her career with figurative images where the influence of <a target="_blank" href="https://www.wikiart.org/en/paintings-by-style/fauvism">Fauvism</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.wikiart.org/en/paintings-by-style/expressionism">Expressionism</a>, and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.wikiart.org/en/paintings-by-style/post-impressionism">Post-Impressionism</a> is evident.<br><br>In front of us is a sleeping girl.

A luxuriant body, bright colors, full lips, a contoured outline, and a feeling of physical health and vitality equals <i>Sleeping Girl</i> to Gauguin's <a target="_blank" href="https://www.wikiart.org/en/paul-gauguin/all-works#!#filterName:Period_1st-tahiti-period,resultType:masonry">Tahitian art</a>.</span>

        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">Portrait of the Infante Don Carlos is a 1626/27 oil painting of Don Carlos of Spain (brother to Philip IV of Spain), produced by <a target="_blank" href="/en/diego-velazquez">Diego Velázquez</a> as one of the first paintings he produced during his stay in Madrid. It is now in the Prado.
<br>
<br>Its subject is in a relaxed and elegant pose, wearing a black costume with grey braids and a thick gold shoulder chain with the Order of the Golden Fleece and holding a hat in his left hand and a glove in his right. The figure appears in the darkest point of the space and the artist added a 4&nbsp;cm strip on each sides to add to its sense of authoritarianism.</span>

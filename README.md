        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">Portrait of Dr. Gachet is one of Van Gogh’s most famous paintings. The subject is Dr. Paul Gachet, who took care of him during his last years of life. Dr. Gachet had been referred to van Gogh by Camille Pissarro. He treated mainly artists, and was an amateur artist himself. Van Gogh’s first impression of the man was that he was sicker than Van Gogh himself. He completed at least three works of the good doctor, all of which depicted his somber mood and melancholic stance. In 1990, the painting received $82.5 million at auction, a record-breaking price, which continues to be one of the highest prices ever paid for a painting at auction. </span>

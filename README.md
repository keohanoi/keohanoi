        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">Heaven does not exist if it is not a place to build every day. Its existence itself becomes the space of doing, and the artwork sacrifices the image to become practice. In this sense <i>Miracle</i> represents a change in the narrative of <i>Seven Seasons of the Spirit</i> series. The opening, on October the 17th of a door riddled by firearm shots as the access of hypothetical heaven has been the beginning of a collective performance made by simple daily actions. These actions in the space get a symbolic charge and then when they come back to daily life, to the houses, they keep that high and positive charge.<br><br>Taking care of a place, healing it as if it was a sick person, cleaning it, taking the bullets out of the walls like they were arrows in the body of a wounded animal, closing with one’s own hands the cracks that reveal the fragility of the shells that we live, becomes a training, a (spiritual?) exercise to read the everyday present in a larger perspective, a vertical perspective.<br><br>(Via delle Zite 40, Napoli)</span>

        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">Partition is one of Louis' so-called Stripe series, all executed in the last months of his life. The vertical stripes evoke Barnett Newman's zip paintings, and, like Newman's work, these canvases are highly systematic and devoid of the painter's own expressive gesture. In these final works, Louis took the simplification of color and form to its extreme end, though he still exhibits interest in optical effects of color relationships and the fusing of paint and ground through his incorporation of the raw canvas into the composition. </span>

Washington, D.C.: The White House Historical Association, 2008:<br><br>"The site interpreted here is probably Battersea, across the Thames from Chelsea. One scholar has suggested that the 'peculiar tower is probably "Morgan's Folly," a 100-foot clock tower built in 1862. . . .' The color in this mystery of blue and black shifts as we watch. . . . This color abstraction . . . astonishes the viewer with an illusion of moonglow-fog gliding over the water. The only fixed point is the exclamation mark tower and its tangible reflection."</span>

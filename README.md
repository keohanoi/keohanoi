        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">"Albers Light" is the sister painting to "Albers Dark" and was stared while David Hinnebusch was studying the work of Joseph Albers and Piet Mondrian under the tutelage of Deborah Sussman at the Santa Monica College of Design Art and Architecture (S.M.C.D.A.A.) in 1997. From a series of brightly colored "Albers" squares printed on paper, "Albers Light" was started. In 2000, Hinnebusch painted to photographic tracing over the squares in celebration of the idea that the artist can triumph over the art they create.</span>

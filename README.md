        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">This elaborate vase belongs to a small class of vessels from Centuripe, a small town in eastern Sicily, where they were apparently made. Characteristically, sumptuous, gilt, high-relief decoration, imitating fine metalwork, is combined with bright tempera paintings. The front and sides of the lid depict a complex scene with several female figures around an altar. One figure holds a tambourine. In the handle-zone, a Medusa head is flanked by Erotes amidst a floral scroll. The finial and base are decorated with shafts of wheat and leaves.<br><br><a target="_blank" href="https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/253048">The Met</a></span>

        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">Sonia (also known as Stella) was the wife of the École de Paris artist Jacob Macznik.  Here, she appears pale but not wasted, in keeping with the fact that she worked indoors as a seamstress (working with both cloth and leather).  Her gaze is slightly downward, her countenance slightly pensive or perhaps even sad.  Behind her, before the mirror, is a sculptured torso done by the painter's younger brother, Ben (Bendet/Beniek) Moncznik (later, Munn), who lived with Jacob and Sonia approximately 1937–1939 in Paris.  [Ben was a brief and largely unknown member of the École de Paris.  Although he survived the Holocaust, he did not return to sculpture.  His pre-war sculptures have never surfaced.]<br><br>This painting is privately held by the artist's nephew.

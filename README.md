        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">Norman Rockwell's 1920 picture of Santa cements the red outfit and jolly, pleasingly plump physique associated with Santa Claus in the popular imagination.  This benevolent, elderly man squints into the distance while going over his account books, a circle of smiling children superimposed behind him.  Dressed in a slightly straining red waistcoat, with a sprig of holly in his hari, Rockwell's Santa is undeniably festive and kind, irrevocably establishing him as the beloved gift-bringer of childhood Christmas dreams.</span>

        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">The Ninth Wave (Russian: Девятый вал, Dyevyatiy val) is an 1850 painting by the Russian Armenian <a target="_blank" href="/en/paintings-by-genre/marina">marine painter</a> <a target="_blank" href="/en/ivan-aivazovsky">Ivan Aivazovsky</a>. It is his best known work.
<br>
<br>The title refers to an old sailing expression referring to a wave of incredible size that comes after a succession of incrementally larger waves.
<br>
<br>It depicts a sea after a night storm and people facing death attempting to save themselves by clinging to debris from a wrecked ship. The debris, in the shape of the cross, appears to be a Christian metaphor for salvation from the earthly sin. The painting has warm tones, which reduce the sea's apparent menacing overtones and a chance for the people to survive seems plausible. This painting shows the destructive side, and beauty of nature.</span>

My work is made of single or multiple panels: rectangle, curved, or square. I am less interested in marks on the panels than the ‘presence’ of the panels themselves. In Red Yellow Blue III the square panels present color. It was made to exist forever in the present; it is an idea and can be repeated anytime in the future.”—Ellsworth Kelly, 1969</span>

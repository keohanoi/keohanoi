        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe"><i>Baby</i> is an action collage, made from randomly assembled objects juxtaposed with cut-up pieces of Kaprow's own paintings. The only coherent and ordered element in the composition is in the formal arrangement of the elements into vertical strips. Kaprow produced the work in a frenzied, ritualistic process, influenced by the gestural quality of <a target="_blank" href="https://www.wikiart.org/en/jackson-pollock">Pollock</a>'s action painting. Kaprow echoes the "combines" of <a target="_blank" href="https://www.wikiart.org/en/robert-rauschenberg">Robert Rauschenberg</a> in his synthesis of Pollock's technique with Cage's influence. Kaprow had moved toward an "unbound," three dimensional form, and was increasingly using found objects and everyday materials in an attempt to reconcile art with everyday experience, which would end up being his ultimate goal.</span>

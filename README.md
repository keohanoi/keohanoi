        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">One of Dezeuze's fondamental works that explains the problematics of the Supports-Surfaces group. He takes a simple stretcher covered by a sheet of transparent plastic exposing the material elements that make up the painting. The visible material of the stretcher and the transparent surface of the plastic which replaces the space of illusion (the canvas) demand a didactic perception of the work. Note that this piece is always placed on the floor, against a wall, in contradiction with a classic type of hanging.</span>

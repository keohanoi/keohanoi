        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">The Women of Algiers caused a sensation when it was displayed at the Paris Salon on 1834. Not only was it mentionable at the time for its sexual connotations, but also for the portrayal of opium, which at the time was only included of paintings of prostitutes. This painting was also notable because it was generally difficult to paint Muslim women, who were covered head to toe, but Delacroix was secretly able to sketch some during his travels to Morocco in 1832. It was critically acclaimed when it was presented to the Salon, and King Louis Philippe bought the painting, presenting it to the Museum of Luxembourg. Seven years after Delacroix’s death, it was moved the Louvre, where it is displayed among Delacroix’s other masterful paintings. </span>

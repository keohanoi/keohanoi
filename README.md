        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">The Three Graces is a grisaille painting by <a target="_blank" href="/en/peter-paul-rubens">Peter Paul Rubens</a>, dating to 1620-1623. It is now held in the Galleria Palatina in Florence.
<br>
<br>It was acquired by Monsignor Francesco Airoldi, nuncio to Brussels, who offered it to cardinal Leopoldo de' Medici, a great admirer of Rubens. The cardinal's art collection passed to the Uffizi after his death - the grisaille was transferred to the Palatina in 1928.</span>

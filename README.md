        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">Large-scale terracotta sculpture began to be made on Cyprus during the mid-seventh century B.C. Molds were used for the heads, while the bodies were handmade. This bearded head wears the helmetlike headgear that appears on the nearby limestone sculptures. Details are articulated with considerable care, and remaining pigment suggests the liveliness of the figures' original appearance.<br><br><a target="_blank" href="https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/241013">The MET</a></span>

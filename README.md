The River of Life theme is prevalent in Tiffany landscapes created for memorials. The years between 1900 and 1910 were the height of ecclesiastical window production for Tiffany Studios and figural windows were in high demand. Landscape windows, such as this example, were an appropriate alternative that provided beauty and nature in such scenes.</span>

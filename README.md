        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">This bowl is attributed to Olowe of Ise because of its unique cantilevered bowl within a bowl design and because of the vigorous style of the geometric relief carvings. In particular the "X in a rectangular panel" motif is found on other Olowe sculptures, notably the figures with bowls in this museum's collection. The form of this design has been compared to that of the Yoruba divination board. The function of this bowl is not known, however scholars have suggested that it could have been used by a diviner.</span>

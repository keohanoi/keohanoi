        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">This intimate interior painted during the wartime blackout shows Pasmore and his wife. In the 1940s Pasmore painted many pure still lifes in which the painted marks are true both to observation and to his love of exploring form itself. This can be seen here in the treatment of the lamp, jug and book. Of the founders of the Euston Road School, Pasmore was the most strongly drawn to the sensuous qualities of paint and colour, not least those found in French art of the nineteenth century.</span>

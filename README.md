        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">In addition to his elaborate set and costume designs, Bakst continued to be a prolific painter until the end of his life. Completed the year he passed away, the Portrait of the Future Countess Henri de Boisgelin is an example of his more mature style. He also produced many landscapes and further portraits of famous painters, dancers, and patrons. His own portrait was also painted by other artists, including Modigliani, Picasso, and Cocteau. As a testament to his artistic ability, two of his most prolific students were Marc Chagall and Jean Reschofsky.</span>

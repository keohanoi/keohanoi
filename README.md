Imposed onto its contoured and annotated landscape are twenty-four orange-coloured labels marking Iceland’s glacial sources of water. It is related to a larger project of Roni Horn’s: Vatnasafn/Library of Water, a permanent installation in the small town of Sykkishólmur in Iceland. The project was commissioned by Artangel, and was the first international project of this London-based organisation. It opened in May 2007.</span>

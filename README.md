        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">Contemporarily held in a private collection, this set of triptychs is both Bacon’s most personal and least experimental paintings. It was created during after a time in which Bacon had lost many close friends, and examines themes of life and death, and the effect of age on the human physique. During the 1970’s Bacon lost his close companion George Dyer, and in the 1980’s, his sister Winifred, as well as other close friends passed away. He was quoted as saying that he was reduced to paint only self portraits because so many people around him had died that the only person he had left to paint was himself. </span>

        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">Bus Riders is a series of fifteen black and white photographs Sherman produced shortly after graduating from the State University College at Buffalo, New York, where she studied art (1972-6). They were not publically exhibited until the artist had them reprinted in late 2000 for an exhibition at Glen Horowitz Booksellers at East Hampton, New York, together with another series from the same period, Murder Mystery People (1976/2000). Both series were reprinted in editions of twenty. Bus Riders and Murder Mystery People provide an important bridge between a series Sherman created as a student, Untitled A, B, C and D 1975, and her first major work, the Untitled Film Stills 1977-80). Like these other early series, Bus Riders may be seen as an exploration of portraiture and the mechanics of its staging.</span>

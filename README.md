        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">This is a portrait of Rachel Dunn, the artist's long-term companion and the subject of numerous works from Goodsir's second Paris period. Wearing a boldly patterned shawl over a pullover, her outfit accessorized by a hat and fan, and with a cigarette in her hand, Cherry, as she was referred to by Goodsir, typifies the 1920s flapper - confident and independent in demeanour, relaxed and comfortable within the cafe environment.</span>

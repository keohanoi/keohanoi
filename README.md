        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">Kaprow produced the extended piece, <i>Trading Dirt</i>, when studying at the Zen Center of San Diego. He began by trading the soil in his garden for the "Buddhist dirt" of the center. This was then traded with various types of dirt collected by Kaprow. This sequence of events went on sporadically for three years, each exchange accompanied by an anecdote, recorded on film. Kaprow presents dirt as a metaphor that only gains meaning as it is exchanged or "traded." This occurred in 1983, long after Kaprow had replaced the Happening with the Activity. The work integrates storytelling with playful humour and illustrates a shift tow<i>ard a more private, intimate participatory exchange. A film, Trading Dirt with Simon Rodia and Allan Kaprow</i> by Rosie Lee Hooks and Paul S. Rogers, was created for the <i>Allan Kaprow: Art as Life</i> exhibition at MOCA Geffen Contemporary in Spring 2008 in addition to a reinvention of the piece.</span>

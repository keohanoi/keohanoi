        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">Soundproof Aesthetic of Luxuriety is a 1976 assemblage by Lubo Kristek. It addresses consumerism as a hidden trap in modern society. The piece belongs to Kristek’s series of critical assemblages in which he dealt with various social phenomena including consumerism, medical ethics and addiction to new technologies.<br>Small traps form a bigger picture – a trap with an upholstered frame, from which no sound can escape. The mother-of-pearl rose, a luxury replica of a living rose, is placed as bait in the sophisticated trap system. The artist refers to craving for luxury substitutes of real values.</span>

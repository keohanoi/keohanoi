        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">Estate (Summer) is a reflection about the inertia as a status of the spirit. It is a work on the hell, according to Pasolini’s standpoint. The analogy used to speak about this theological concept is the history of the Republic of Italy, a country that little by little had lost its own identity and heritage leaving things going badly without doing anything. The space chosen for this work is the first registry office in Italy, currently abandoned. The belly of this building is full of all the documents of the citizens of Naples from 1809 to the present day. The installation is an epic of decay. The falling of the building is the falling of the State itself, the decay of the walls, of the ceiling of that construction is the decay of a body in which every citizen is a living cell slowly dying.<br><br>(ex Anagrafe Comunale, Napoli)</span>

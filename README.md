Fantastic images of animals and dragons alternate with hunting and fighting scenes. The portrayal of a man with a long lance hunting a dangerous boar is extremely naturalistic. Medieval artists would have seen such scenes in hunting scenes depicted on Roman ivory panels, some of which have survived to this day. It is possible that this superficially profane scene symbolises the victory over evil.</span>

        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">This painting belongs to the series devoted to 'Night Carnivals' a series the artist hoped would evoke aspects and dilemmas of our human condition. The critic Edward Lucie-Smith has suggested of Rose's paintings "What they offer, instead, is a sharply focussed vision of the way the world really is. That vision is then transported, complete, into a parallel universe – that of the cooks, in their distnctve outits, sometmes wearing their tall chef’s hats."</span>

A wooden cover, sometimes called a "mummy board," was placed over the body. This mummy board is carved and painted to represent the deceased as if she were alive and dressed in a long white pleated gown. <br><br><a target="_blank" href="https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/561774">The Met</a></span>

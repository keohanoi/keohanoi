        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">The influence of Japanese prints on many early Modernists, including Courbet, is well-documented. In fact, some argue that Courbet was among the first artists to be impacted by this Eastern aesthetic. Inspired by the prints, he portrays a portion of water enclosed from the view of vast space. This painting is a prime example of Courbet's landscapes and seascapes, which consist of fragmented patches of paint applied in both the dark and light areas. This technique served as inspiration for the budding Impressionists.</span>

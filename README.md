        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">This large (almost life-size) superb painting by the École de Paris artist Jacob Macznik is of his wife Sonia (also known as Stella; née Miedzinska) seated slightly sideways on the side of their bed, crocheting.  Sonia was a seamstress by profession (working with both cloth and leather).  The mood evoked at the masterful hand of Macznik is tenderness, and perhaps even quiet admiration for the assiduous nature of his beloved.  She is a bit off-center in the canvas, which helps to reveal emptiness elsewhere in the room.  The bright blue of her dress, the orange-red of the crocheted item, and the thin red curvy lines within the bedspread are highlighted and stand out against the more muted colors elsewhere.  Despite the religiously observant (even orthodox) upbringings of all three, Sonia (born 1899) and her sister Fanny Miedzinska (born 1902) lived together with Jacob in Paris as a loving threesome.  None of the three survived the Holocaust.<br><br>This painting is privately held by the artist's nephew.

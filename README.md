Perhaps the fruity images of summer are best known. For example, in the movie series “Harry Potter,” there is a bowl of fruit at the entrance to a door. Upon requiring entrance, the fruit will sit up, frown, and shake its head no for no entrance allowed, or sit up, smile, and nod its head, allowing entrance into the room.</span>

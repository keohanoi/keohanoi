        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">‘The Sequence’, an 80-metre-long and 15-metre-high sculpture immediately provided the direct vicinity of the Flemish parliament with a new feeling of zest. Since November 2008, a gigantic wooden construction has dominated the Louvain Road and connects the Flemish parliament to the House of Flemish Representatives. A bended and twisting structure seems to be penetrating both buildings and therewith gives the illusion of both buildings being inextricably connected with each another.<br><br>The structure, located above the centre platform and supported by wooden posts ranging from between 8 and 16 metres high, hovers above the<br>street. Arne Quinze’s construction, placed in front of the Flemish parliament, which already has a rich tradition of gathering modern works of art, provides a unique billboard. people deliberately come down to this neighbourhood to experience the manner in which the sculpture explicitly changes the street scene.<br><br>‘The Sequence’ builds a bridge between people. The visible connection between the Flemish parliament and its Administrative Centre reflects the connection between all the different neighbours in Brussels. A meeting between all cultures present in our capital.</span>

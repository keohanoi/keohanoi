A set of identical platforms were constructed, numbered and installed in selected locations around the city. Local interactions with the platforms were documented by the artist in b/w and colour photographs. The documentation was shown at the museum along with one platform and a text outlining the project. One platform was also positioned just outside the entrance to the museum.</span>

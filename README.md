        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">The Annunciation is a painting by the Italian Renaissance painter <a target="_blank" href="/en/filippo-lippi">Filippo Lippi</a>. Dating to 1440-45, it is housed in the Galleria Nazionale d'Arte Antica of Palazzo Barberini, Rome.

<br>The composition pivots around the Virgin, who occupies the centre of the scene. In the background, on the right, two small figures of women are riding a stair. The two donor portraits show the unknown donors kneeling behind a cordonata. That they were represented in natural size (i.e., in the same size as the religious figures) was a relatively new stylistic feature.</span>

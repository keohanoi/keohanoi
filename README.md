        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">The cameo of a dancer in billowing robes is situated right at the centre of the front of the shrine just above the removable trapezoidal central panel. The billowing robes and the plastic shape of the body are similar to those of the prophets depicted on the sides of the shrine, which were created by Nicholas of Verdun. It is known that the goldsmiths in Nicholas of Verdun’s workshop learned from ancient works, so it is possible that this cameo was used as a template for the body shape and robe design of other figures on the shrine.</span>

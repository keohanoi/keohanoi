        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">The skin of this lumbering bronze figure is imprinted with broken machine-parts and other industrial debris. Paolozzi made it by pressing pieces of metal into a bed of moist clay, and then pouring molten wax into the clay mould. He constructed the model from these sheets of wax forms and finally cast it in bronze. Based on the brutish one-eyed giants of classical mythology, its pierced armour and dilapidated state has been seen as an ironic comment on the condition of man in the nuclear age.</span>

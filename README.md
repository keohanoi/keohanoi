It is made up of red brick, steel, concrete, and concrete block. It is an open-ended tower rising 30' with a diameter of 9' 4". Two 10' arches on a north-south axis allow entry at ground level. Four similar 8' openings all face the cardinal points. Low berms at the east and west sides lead up to two of the slotted windows that look into and through the piece.</span>

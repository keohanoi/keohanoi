        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">Self-portrait with Sir Endymion Porter is a self-portrait by <a target="_blank" href="/en/anthony-van-dyck">Anthony van Dyck</a>, showing him with his patron Sir Endymion Porter.
<br>
<br>The painting was produced in 1635 and measures 119&nbsp;cm by 127&nbsp;cm. It is now in the Museo del Prado in Madrid, Spain.
<br>
<br>It is van Dyck's only self-portrait to include another figure, showing Porter's importance in his life. The pair had first met in 1620, during van Dyck's first stay in London. Porter was Charles I of England's main art dealer, negotiating to acquire the vast art collection of the Duke of Mantua and also collecting art for himself. He also knew <a target="_blank" href="/en/peter-paul-rubens">Peter Paul Rubens</a> and <a target="_blank" href="/en/orazio-gentileschi">Orazio Gentileschi</a>. Van Dyck presented the double portrait to Porter himself - it was later acquired by Isabella Farnese, who owned it by 1745, and passed from her collection to the Prado.</span>

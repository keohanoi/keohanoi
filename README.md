        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">Simon Hantaï's solo exhibition was held in January-February 1953, shortly after the Hungarian, who had settled in France in 1949, deposited one of his works on Breton's landing. Hantaï presented sixteen large paintings in the exhibition, including Femelle-miroir II, presented here. In his preface, Breton hailed the artist "for whom corteges of fabulous beings line up. endowed with life by the artist's breath and moving like nothing else in unprecedented light in these first days of 1953".</span>

        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">Kauffman's portrait of Joshua Reynolds, the influential English painter, depicts him in a relaxed and informal manner, reflecting their friendship. Reynolds is surrounded by his books and papers, and a bust of Michelangelo stands to the far left, symbolizing the inspiration that passes between artists. The vivid colors and Reynolds' seventeenth-century clothing evoke the portraits of Anthony van Dyck, the Flemish artist whom Kauffman was hailed to succeed upon her arrival in London. However, unlike van Dyck's formal style, Kauffman's portrait captures a personal glimpse into the life of her subject, revealing a touching sentimentality that became a defining feature of her portraiture.<br><br>Kauffman's ability to render her subjects humble and human was evident in her other portraits as well, such as the actor David Garrick and the German archaeologist and antiquarian Winckelmann. Throughout her time in England, Reynolds remained an important friend and contact for Kauffman. He introduced her to potential clients and helped her to maintain her reputation after the scandal of her first marriage. The intimacy and trust between the two artists are evident in Reynolds' expression in the portrait.</span>

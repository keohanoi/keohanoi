        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">The Descent from the Cross is a triptych panel painting, depicting many men lowering Jesus from the Cross. This painting clearly shows the influence of Michelangelo, Caravaggio, and Tintoretto, all of whose paintings influenced Rubens a great deal. Rubens completed the painting after returning to Flanders from Italy, after the death of his mother in 1608. This painting, along with The Elevation of the Cross, was taken from Belgium by Napoleon, but they were later returned at the end of the 19th century. They are both now located in the Cathedral of Our Lady in Antwerp.</span>

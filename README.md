        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">The Portrait of a Cardinal is a painting by the Italian Renaissance artist <a target="_blank" href="/en/raphael">Raphael</a>. It is housed in the Prado Museum in Madrid.
<br>
<br>The Cardinal has been identified as either Alidosi, Bibbiena, Cybo or Trivulzio, in the court of Pope Julius II.
<br>
<br>Painted in Rome, Rafael mastered the art of realism in his paintings, the ability to “paint people as more real than they really are,” as his peers put it.
<br>
<br>Like Leonardo da Vinci’s Mona Lisa, the subject is seated, with formation of a triangle pyramid by the subjects' body and arms. The contrasts are striking between the red of his hat, whiteness of his sleeve and his face. Meticulous brushstrokes give the audience a three-dimensional character, revealing Rapahel’s interest in sculpture during those years.
<br>
<br>The painting was acquired by Carlos IV of Spain (1748–1819) in Rome, while the latter was still a prince.
<br>
<br>The picture was attributed to Antonio Moro, due to its technique, considered unusual in Raphael.</span>

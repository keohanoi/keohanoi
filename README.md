        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">Presentazione di Gesù al Tempio is a fresco by <a target="_blank" href="/en/fra-angelico">Fra Angelico</a> made for a monastery. This is one of a limited number of paintings whose composition and brightness suggest that the monk Fra Angelico was involved in their creation. However some of the painting indicated that less skilled hands also assisted. The painting dates from 1450 to 1452 when Angelico was the Prior of San Domenico in Fiesole. Today the work can be seen at the National Museum of San Marco in Florence.</span>

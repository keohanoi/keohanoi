        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">War was inspired by a news photograph taken during the recent Iraq war. A close-up of a young girl’s face dominated almost half of the photograph, while a woman in the background held her child stoically. Rego transformed the original image, using a cast of rabbits and other hybrid creatures. As in Rego’s earlier pastels, such figures hark back to a subversive and psychologically troubling tradition of folk tales and fairy tales that explore themes of violence and sexuality..</span>

        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">This painting is one of Modigliani’s earlier works, and as such has much more of a traditional look. This painting is also indicative of the artist’s later style in the figure’s elongated neck and the still, somber emotion on her face. There is also much more detail in her clothing and her face than in Modigliani’s later works, which are characterized by simple lines and few discernable features. Early on as an artist, Modigliani preferred life-drawn women subjects, many of whom engaged in love affairs with the handsome painter. One only wonders if this was one such subject. </span>

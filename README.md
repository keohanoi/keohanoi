        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">This is one of the most famous portraits created by Modigliani. The painting is of a woman named Beatrice Hastings, who had a love affair with the artist for over two years, and sat for many of his paintings. This portrait illustrates the artist’s style of turning the face into a mask-like image, and the elongation of the form of the body, in this case an exaggeratedly long and thin neck. The subject is also perhaps a bit of a social critique, as the pompadour is also in his stylized, exaggerated form of simple lines, using a traditional image to steer away from the traditional style of painting. </span>

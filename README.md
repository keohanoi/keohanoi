        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">200 Miles to Los Angeles, 36 x 90 ins., acrylic on inkjet print paper with photographs on wood, was made in Hinnebusch's Santa Monica studio in 2009. In 2008 he purchased a large format printer and began obsessively printing his photographs and self- portraits to use in new works. This painting is a triptych of three images; The left his model and collector Mia Weier; the center an "amazing" frozen frame of a traffic sign on the California Interstate 5 Freeway shot by a reclining Hinnebusch with a small digital camera from the back seat of a moving car (Hinnebusch drawing models Lisa Cherry driving and Chandra Richards front seat passenger); the print on the right a photo-collage of drawings and personal photographs.

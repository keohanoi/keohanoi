        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">The Madonna with Writing Child is a painting by the Italian Renaissance master <a target="_blank" href="/en/pinturicchio">Pinturicchio</a>, painted around 1494-1498 and housed in the Philadelphia Museum of Art, in the United States.
<br>
<br>The painting is derived from the Madonna of the Peace (c. 1490), a simplification for a less acculturated commissioner, perhaps a private family. The Virgin sits on a kind of cask, and is offering a book to the Child, who writes on it. The garments of the Child are perhaps inspired by the late Byzantine mosaics seen by Pinturicchio in Rome.
<br>
<br>In the background is a small depiction of the Flight into Egypt and two symmetrical trees, one which is a palm, a symbol of martyrdom.</span>

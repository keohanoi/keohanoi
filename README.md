        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">In 1913, Filonov founded an artistic group, which consisted only of artists devoted to following the techniques and style of analytical art. The next year, he produced a written manifesto of his artistic theory, The Made Paintings, which set down the many tenets of artistic philosophy. Flowers of the Universal Flowering was created during this period, in which Filonov’s paintings were encrypted in such a way as to be completely non-representational to the viewer. His intent was to make the objects intermingle, or flower, within one another and become something entirely different, in an effort to make the invisible world of the soul visible on the canvas. </span>

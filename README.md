        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">Somber colors remain the rule rather than the exception in this rare self-portrait of the artist at age twenty-six. Painted six years after the artist moved from Dallas to New York, the advanced technique, facility with modeling, and distinctive color scheme show the artist coming into his own. His typically intense sober expression and simple attire convey a determined, perceptive, and serious spirit; however, the pompadour that tops off his handsome countenance may suggest an artist who is just as familiar with contemporary fashion as he is with developments in contemporary painting.</span>

        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">Self-Portrait, or Portrait of the Artist in a Redingote, is an 1835 oil-on-canvas painting by French <a target="_blank" href="/en/artists-by-art-movement/romanticism">romantic</a> artist <a target="_blank" href="/en/theodore-chasseriau">Théodore Chassériau</a>, which was painted when the artist was 16. It is currently housed at the Musée du Louvre.
<br>
<br>One of the few self-portraits Chassériau painted, Portrait of the Artist in a Redingote shows him standing and facing left, one hand concealed within his black jacket, a small book held within his other hand, at rest upon a red tablecloth. In the background is a gray-green wall, upon which hangs a palette in the upper left corner. The painter's pose is elegant, and his gaze has been described as "astonishingly young, and at the same time, weary".
<br>
<br>Although the painting has been compared to classical and contemporary prototypes—portraits by <a target="_blank" href="/en/raphael">Raphael</a>, <a target="_blank" href="/en/agnolo-bronzino">Bronzino</a>, <a target="_blank" href="/en/titian">Titian</a>, and Ingres have been cited as inspirations—the painting is consistent with a series of portraits of family members painted by Chassériau in his youth. The portrait is a frank portrayal of Chassériau's unattractive features, much commented upon during his life: Alice Ozy, later his mistress, referred to him as "the monkey". By comparison, a self-portrait of 1838, also in the Louvre, appears more idealized.</span>

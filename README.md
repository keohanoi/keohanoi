It was built inside a refrigerating room in a no-profit art space in Rome. Beyond the door, there is a room that doesn’t really exist but is a synthesis of many rooms that represent authority in my memories. There is an iron closet, a desk of a teacher, and a dead mouse in a dish on it. The other zoomorphic figure in the room is the body of the crucified. In the center of the room, there is a yardstick that comes out from the floor. The room and the furniture are 20% downsized.<br><br>(Wunderkammern, Roma)</span>

        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">Religion saved by Spain is an oil on canvas painting produced between 1572-1575 by the Italian master of the Venetian school, <a target="_blank" href="/en/titian">Titian</a> (c. 1488/(1482) – 1576) commemorating the Battle of Lepanto. It is a late work by Titian, and it is considered as an outstanding piece by Titian. It was purchased by the Prado Museum collection in 1839. Other titles are Spain succoring Religion or Religion succored by Spain.
<br>
<br>Spain rescues Religion depicts an allegory, mixing the allegory with political propaganda, portraying Spain as a woman in a dramatic landscape, with a shield in her right hand and a spear with the flag of Victory on it, while the Turkish threat is shown by a man wearing a turban in a chariot with two horses on the sea. On the shield there is the coat of arms of Felipe II (1556-1598). The person symbolizing the Christian Religion is depicted as a woman, to the right, falling on her knees, covered with a blue drapery, threatened by snakes.
<br>
<br>In the Battle of Lepanto the troops of the Holy League defeated Selim II (1524-1574). This Holy League was formed by an alliance of Spain, Venice and the Papal States. The battle stopped the expansion of the Ottoman Empire further in Europe.</span>

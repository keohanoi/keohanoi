        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">An advertisement for a drainpipe was the source for this work. Like many of Oldenburg's sculptures, it renders a familiar object strange through its recreation in surprising materials and colours. The transformation of hard into soft objects is a recurrent theme in his sculpture. Adjusting the pulley can alter the appearance and dimensions of the work, producing a variety of shapes that suggest a crucified figure, an elephant's trunk and ears, or male genitalia.</span>

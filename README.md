        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">Rather than eating a traditional Passover meal of lamb, Jesus and the disciples appear to be enjoying a plate of <i>cuy</i> (guinea pig, a common meat dish enjoyed to this day in Peru), shown in the center of the table. The inclusion of the cuy in this painting is due to the difference in cuisine, but also is an example of symbolism: lamb was a sacrificial animal in the Judeo-Christian tradition, but cuy was a sacrificial animal in traditional Inca ceremonies. By using a symbol of sacrifice that was more meaningful to the Peruvian people, the artist makes a statement about the sacrifice in the story of Easter. The spread on the table shows that Jesus and the disciples are enjoying <i>chicha</i>, a Peruvian drink, and native fruits and vegetables such as potatoes, peppers, and corn. It is believed that the artist painted Judas, the disciple who betrayed Jesus (shown at the bottom of the painting, holding the money bag, dressed in red and looking out at the viewer), to bear a resemblance to Francisco Pizarro, the Spanish conquistador responsible for the fall of the Inca empire.</span>

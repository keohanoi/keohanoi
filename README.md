        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">One of Haacke's targets is Charles Saatchi, a powerful collector of contemporary art and trustee of the Tate Gallery in London who recently opened his own museum in that city. Charles and Maurice Saatchi are the founders of Saatchi &amp; Saatchi, perhaps the largest advertising agency in the world. ''Global Marketing'' is a large black cube on which Haacke has documented in black letters the scope of Saatchi's business involvements in South Africa. The black on black recalls the tough, 1960's black-on-black paintings of Ad Reinhardt, but in Haacke's work the glossy black on matte black also suggests a tuxedo. The box builds on the deathly quality of Tony Smith's black cubic sculpture ''Die.'' (Michael Brenson)</span>

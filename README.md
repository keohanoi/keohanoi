      <p class="description">
        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">In 1981, leading conceptual artist Sol LeWitt was invited by the Fairmount Park Art Association (currently known as the Association for Public Art) to propose a public artwork for a site in Fairmount Park. He selected the long, rectangular plot of land known as the Reilly Memorial and submitted a drawing with instructions. Installed thirty years after its conception, Lines in Four Directions in Flowers is a work of monumental scale, made up of more than 7,000 plantings arranged in strategically configured rows. In his original proposal, the artist describes an installation of flower plantings of "four different colors (white, yellow, red &amp; blue) in four equal rectangular areas, in rows of four directions (vertical, horizontal, diagonal right &amp; left) framed by evergreen hedges of about 2’ height. In the winter the rows of plants would retain their linear direction, in the summer the flowers would bloom and provide the color."</span>

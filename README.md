        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">Portrait of Don Luis de Góngora is a 1622 painting in oils of the poet Luis de Góngora by <a target="_blank" href="/en/diego-velazquez">Diego Velázquez</a>. It is influenced by <a target="_blank" href="/en/caravaggio">Caravaggio</a>, especially in its chiaroscuro, and also applies lessons Velazquez had learned in Italy, such as the rich palette as used by <a target="_blank" href="/en/titian">Titian</a>. It is now in the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. The portrait was commissioned with the assistance of Velázquez's teacher, <a target="_blank" href="/en/francisco-pacheco">Francisco Pacheco</a>.
<br>
<br>There are two other versions of this portrait of uncertain attribution. One is held by the Museo Lázaro Galdiano, Madrid, and the other by the Prado.</span>

      <p class="description">
        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">This painting, considered Klee’s masterpiece, is an example of Klee’s masterful skill with color. Small blocks of shifting colors float through the background, set in place with a thick black outline, evincing the idea of a building or a house. It is also the finest example of Klee’s ability in pointillism and technical ability as an artist. As an artist with great skill with color, he was also a great teacher at color mixing and theory. He wrote his great treatise, a collection of lectures, entitled Writings on Form and Design Theory, which is considered one of the most influential writings in modern art. </span>

        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">The theme of the industrial and technological power of the United States, embodied in the engineering masterwork of the Brooklyn Bridge, was one that Stella explored repeatedly.
<br>
<br>The overall composition of Bridge calls to mind an altarpiece. Massive cables arc upward, and we glimpse indistinct city skyscrapers through the archways. Framing the bottom of the painting (like a predella, the base of an altar) are black, gray, electric-blue, and luminous yellow circles representing subways — the veins and arteries that connect the inhabitants of New York's vast landscape.

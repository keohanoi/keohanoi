        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">"The Battle of the Pictures" was originally engraved by William Hogarth as a bidder's ticket for the auction of his paintings from such sets as A Harlot's Progress, A Rake's Progress and The Four Times of the Day. Like Analysis of Beauty, Characters Caricaturas and Boys Peeping at Nature it represents a statement by Hogarth upon the nature of art and aesthetic values. It also represents a scathing commentary upon the business auction houses, institutions whose ethics are as suspect today as they were in the eighteenth century. The auction house appears to the left. A crack symbolically appears on its front wall. To the side of the main door an over-framed painting rests. To the front of the auction house stand long rows of pictures. The first is original but all the others are copies or fakes.
<br>
<br>William Hogarth's studio appears to the right. Appearing on the easel is a painting from "Marriage a la Mode". Other canvases from "The Four Times of the Day" (Morning), "A Harlot's Progress" and "A Rake's Progress" are also apparent. A grouping of old master paintings, such as representations of St. Francis and Mary Magdalene, lead an attack, some stabbing through Hogarth's outnumbered paintings.
<br>
<br>In "Time Smoking a Picture" Hogarth attacked the general fashion in England for collecting 'old master' paintings in poor condition or of suspicious quality. In "The Battle of the Pictures" Hogarth is fighting a losing battle against bad art.
<br>
<br>This original engraving was both designed and engraved by William Hogarth and published by William Heath in 1822.</span>

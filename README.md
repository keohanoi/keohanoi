        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">This portrait of George Washington was painted by Charles Willson Peale in 1776, shortly before the Second Continental Congress convened and issued the Declaration of Independence. Washington wears the light blue sash of Commander in Chief, a commission he received in June 1775. Peale painted a total of seven portraits of Washington that spanned two decades of his life, dating from his colonial military career in 1772 to the later years of his presidency in 1795. Washington served as the Commander in Chief of the Continental Army during the American Revolution. The first president was in office from April 30, 1789 until March 4, 1797.</span>

        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe"><i>Prismes électriques</i> is focused around two large overlapping circles created by arcs or curved forms of primary and secondary colors placed one beside the other. The remainder of the canvas is covered by other areas of color noted in a variety of shapes both geometric, such as arcs, rectangles, and oval-like shapes, more abstract and all connected as if sewn together like a tapestry.<br><br>This work also exemplifies the way that life influenced Delaunay's art. Apparently she and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.wikiart.org/en/robert-delaunay">Robert</a> were walking down the boulevard Saint-Michel when they came upon newly installed electric lamplights. Both artists tried to recreate the impressive glow from these new inventions in their artwork. In this painting, we see how Sonia tried to replicate the way these artificial lights cast colors onto the sidewalk beneath by sketching rapid, semi-circular colored lines.</span>

        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">The Serenade is an oil painting by <a target="_blank" href="/en/judith-leyster">Judith Leyster</a> in the collection of the Rijksmuseum. It was attributed for centuries to <a target="_blank" href="/en/frans-hals">Frans Hals</a> until Wilhelm von Bode saw it in the Six collection in 1883. He noticed the prominent "J" in the signature, and attributed it to Jan Hals. This is one of seven paintings first properly attributed to Leyster by Hofstede de Groot ten years later in 1893.
<br>
<br>Originally in the collection of the Amsterdam art collector Pieter van Winter (1745-1807), the painting came into the Six collection through his daughter's marriage to Hendrik Six van Hillegom. A mezzotint of this painting was made for Van Winter in 1803 by Frederik Christiaan Bierweiler and inscribed "F. Hals pinxit ... F.C. Bierweiler fecit 1803".
<br>
<br>After it was attributed to Leyster, the Rijksmuseum purchased the paintings from the Six heirs of Jhr. P.H. Six van Vromade together with 38 other paintings with support from the Vereniging Rembrandt in 1908. The painting is signed and dated "1629 / J*".
<br>
<br>According to Hofrichter, the scene shows a lute player in the "Honthorst style" of indirect candle light from below. The musician is looking upward and to the left in another characteristic Leyster pose.</span>

        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">The End of the War: Starting Home reflects Horace Pippin’s traumatic wartime experiences. The artist started working on this painting nearly fifteen years after he returned to the United States from serving in France in World War I. Wounded in his right arm while fighting as a member of one of four African American regiments to see combat, Pippin had turned to painting to help his process of recovery. This image of combat, fear, and surrender condenses terrifying episodes he had documented in his wartime journals—events he later said “brought out all the art in me.” The frame, which shows weaponry and helmets, further heightens the poignancy of Pippin’s depiction of the human dimension of war.</span>

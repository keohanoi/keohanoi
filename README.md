In a traditional gesture of farewell, he clasps the hand of a tall woman dressed in a pale chiton and himation. Another man wearing a dark violet himation stands behind him. The background is divided vertically into two areas, grey on the left and violet on the right. The style and subject matter of this quiet, well-balanced scene derive from Greek grave reliefs of the 4th century B.C. Although this stele was found resting against the wall in an underground tomb, its large size and the tenon cut at the bottom suggest that it was originally set in a base, above ground.<br><br><a target="_blank" href="https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/247107">The MET</a></span>

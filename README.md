Isetweret lived in Akhmim, an important religious and cultural center in the Ptolemaic Period that was closely connected to the fertility god Min. The face of the coffin is nicely modelled and its bright color stands out against the dark hair and body.<br><br><a target="_blank" href="https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/551160">The Met</a></span>

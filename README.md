        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">This artwork portrays a scene from the village of Gennevilliers, which is situated just outside Paris and was owned by the Manet family, who were related to Morisot's husband. This location was a popular spot for many Impressionist artists, including Monet, who found inspiration for their works in this area. The painting itself features a pleasing visual arrangement of three horizontal color bands, separated by the presence of a young boy on the right side of the canvas. The wheat that gives the painting its title is located at the center of the canvas, drawing the viewer's gaze to it.<br><br>Morisot's loose brushwork renders the wheat in a hazy manner, while the buildings in the background are painted with slightly more clarity, revealing the smokestacks of the factories that dominate the horizon. This contrast highlights the changing nature of the landscape from agricultural to industrial, reflecting the city's growth and the gradual disappearance of the rural way of life. In the foreground, a figure emerges from the edge of the wheat field, carrying his belongings on his shoulder. This figure could represent the archetypal rural villager who is trying to flee from the encroaching industrialization. Hence, Morisot's artwork can be interpreted as both a charming representation of the countryside and a subtle critique of modern life's transformation, a theme that many French painters, from the Realists to the post-Impressionists, found popular.</span>

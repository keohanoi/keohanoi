        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">Behavior Art School (Cátedra Arte de Conducta), conceived in 1998 by Tania Bruguera and implemented during 2002-2009 in Havana, is a public art framework, institutional framework, and long-term intervention "intended to create a space of alternative training to the system of art studies in contemporary Cuban society". It was focused on "the discussion and analysis of sociopolitical behavior and the understanding of art as an instrument for the transformation of ideology through the activation of civic action on its environment", aiming to transform certain spaces of society through art, understood not as symbolic representation, but as continuous transdisciplinary activity.<br><br>The project, involving guest professors from various artistic fields as well as sociology, engineering, and other professional areas, included free of charge activities such as workshops, debates, the creation of an international contemporary art archive, as well as thematic exhibitions consisting of pieces made by members who participated in events organized by guest curators. As Tania Bruguera states, "members of the project manage a flow of information allowing them to understand and choose their position vis-à-vis art and society."<br><br>Bruguera's project "has become a model for educational projects of a social and artistic nature and for artistic projects focused in offering educational activities".</span>

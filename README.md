        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">Transfiguration of Christ is a c.1480 oil on panel painting by the Italian Renaissance master <a target="_blank" href="/en/giovanni-bellini">Giovanni Bellini</a>, now in the housed in the Capodimonte Gallery of Naples, Italy.
<br>
<br>By this time Bellini had abandoned <a target="_blank" href="/en/artists-by-art-movement/gothic-art">Gothic art</a> and outgrown the influence of <a target="_blank" href="/en/andrea-mantegna">Mantegna</a>. The picture shows a more relaxed style than his earlier Transfiguration. The work is signed IOANNES BELLINUS on a small chart hanging from the fence in the foreground. The leaves of the tree on the right, as well as the faces of James and Peter, are from a later restoration.</span>

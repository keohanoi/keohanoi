        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">Rumor is a work on the oval paintings that displays thick black stain, a shadow, a silhouette of a thrown away and deserted suit jacket. Amorph and dramatic postures of this form express general spatial symbolics of body exclusion. The abstract form of the suit, jacket, rag, or a cloth invites a memory of the body that is not there, but can only be indicated. Hence the existing state of deserted or folded suit jacket communicates the fundamental desolation and the loss of individuality.</span>

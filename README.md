        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">Alone in the World (French: Seule au Monde) is a painting created by nineteenth-century French artist <a target="_blank" href="/en/william-adolphe-bouguereau">William-Adolphe Bouguereau</a>. Although the exact year of creation is unknown, Theo van Gogh acquired it in 1867 so it may be placed in the early part of Bouguereau's career.

<br>The painting depicts a peasant girl holding a violin and standing on a bridge over the Seine in Paris. She is looking to her left with a melancholy expression. The cathedral of Notre Dame can be seen in the background, as well as a bridge which appears to be the Pont Royal. This indicates that the girl is standing on the Pont de Solférino.</span>

      <p class="description">
        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">Early Moonrise, Florida is a subjectively painted landscape of Inness and his peers interpreted rather than recorded nature views, their rich palettes, loose brushwork, and inventive use of light evoking palpable atmospheric effects and, above all, a strong sense of mood. This approach set them apart from the Hudson River school artists’ detailed, tightly brushed transcriptions of nature.</span>

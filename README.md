        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">Ippolito Caffi spent 7 months in Nice, from May to November 1852, where he painted several views across the bay of Nice. Another version of the present lot with almost identical dimensions is held by the Ca’Pesaro Museum of Modern Art. The picture depicts the coast at Nice, one of Caffi’s favorite views. It was painted from a high vantage point, looking towards the terrace on the right which divides the old town and the Boulevard. On the left the deep blues of the Mediterranean are bathed in the brilliance of the southern light. The castle lay directly behind the artist as he worked.<br><br>The Quai du Midi was later renamed the Quai des Etats-Unis.<br><br>(Description taken from dorotheum)</span>

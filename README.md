        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">Forest and Dove exemplifies Ernst's pioneering "grattage" technique - the painting equivalent of frottage - where he scraped paint across the canvas to reveal imprints of objects beneath. The small dove within the menacing forest that threatens to consume it is a familiar motif in Ernst's work, referring to his dispossession after the war. </span>

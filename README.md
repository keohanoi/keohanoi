        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">The portable and hand-driven “Méta-Matic No. 14” emphasises the happening aspect even more dramatically than the other drawing machines. Here it becomes particularly obvious that it is the moment of drawing, the interaction between art viewer (art user) and machine sculpture that actually constitutes the artwork, and that the drawing produced in the process is more like a document of a lived interaction than an artwork in its own right.</span>

        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">In this wonderful Macznik painting, note the skillful use of color: a thin red roofline of the barn, the ominous blue-purple sky, the lush green grass (partially shaded).  Late enough in the year for most of the trees' leaves to have fallen, yet early enough for the grass still to be bright green.  We see from the grass that night has not yet fallen, and we know from the sky that a storm is likely brewing.<br><br>This painting is privately held by the artist's nephew.

In 1975, he found a frozen fox's skeleton still bearing the remnants of dried skin in the woods. He decided to explore the death taboo in an action that he called "Promenade with a Neurotic Fox". He took the skeleton for a walk along the river Lech on the famous colonnade in Landsberg. His aim was to break the stereotype image of reality of passers-by, to observe their reactions and react to their reactions.</span>

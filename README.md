        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">The Portrait of Giovanna Tornabuoni is a painting by the Italian Renaissance painter <a target="_blank" href="/en/domenico-ghirlandaio">Domenico Ghirlandaio</a>, executed in 1488 and located in the Museo Thyssen-Bornemisza, Madrid.
<br>
<br>The painting portrays Giovanna degli Albizzi, a Florentine noblewoman who was married to Lorenzo Tornabuoni. She died in childbirth in 1488, year on the cartolina (Italian for a slip of paper in the background). The painting was actually painted after her death, around 1489-90. She has been identified thanks to her other portraits in the Tornabuoni Chapel, where she has the same hair style.
<br>
<br>It depicts the young woman from the side, wearing precious clothes including a gamurra vest. On the right, behind her, are a hanging coral necklace (perhaps a rosary), a partly closed prayers book and a Latin inscription, taken from an epigram by the 1st century AD poet Martial.</span>

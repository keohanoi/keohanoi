        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">The painting “Two Lives” is about the harmony between two forms of beauty; natural, represented by the tree and man-made, represented by the jug with flowers. Both are beautiful in their own right and bring us joy. Sometimes we don’t know which one brings more.</span>

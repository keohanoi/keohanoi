        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">In the mid-1940s Pasmore painted a series of views of the Thames at Chiswick. In doing so he was following a tradition which goes back to nineteenth century painters, including Turner and Whistler. Pasmore was aware of these precedents when he worked on the series and, like those artists, concentrated on the subtle light variations and the atmosphere of the scene. The timeless romanticism of the diffused light and the horse and cart belie the reality of the place, which was then an industrial area: the dark form on the right is the roof of an especially odorous vitamin factory.</span>

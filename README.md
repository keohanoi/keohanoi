        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">This painting is the pendant of the equally large roundel of Summer, likewise dated 1625. As might be expected, for Winter the artist painted a crowd of people enjoying themselves on a frozen canal near an – imaginary – castle. However, even though Van Goyen’s winter is frosty, there is no snow on the ground. A Dutch winter landscape without snow is rare indeed!</span>

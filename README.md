The space is a representation of what happened on the night of May 1st, 1945 in some bunker under the European ground. It was the last night of the Third Reich. It was the last night of the Modern Age. It was the night in which Joseph Goebbels officiated a macabre ritual to last that night forever.<br><br>(via Panisperna, 61, Roma)</span>

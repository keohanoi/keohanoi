The work consists of a a hole dug into the ground, 2.7 metres deep and 2.2 metres in diameter, the excavated earth being compacted into a cylinder of identical dimensions. In 2008, 40 years after the original version, Sekine had his work recreated in Tamagawa’s Den-en Chofu Seseragi Park for an exhibition of outdoor art, “Tama Art Line Project”.</span>

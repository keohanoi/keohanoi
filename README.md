        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">Bernini carves a bust for English King Charles I from a painting by Van Dyke. It was commissioned by Pope Urban VIII as a gift to the Queen Henrietta Maria in hopes that Charles would reconnect with the Catholic Church. The sculpture was greatly admired by the King. Unfortunately it was lost in the fire in the Whitehall Palace in 1698. This is a photo of it's copy.</span>

        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">Still another superb example of the use of color by the masterful colorist, École de Paris artist Jacob Macznik.  This playful still-life looks downward on various items atop a table, so that the background is not the wall, but rather the carpeted floor.  There is black, white, and every shade in between.  And red, orange, umber, green, blue . . . .  He made them all work together with reality, yet skillfully avoiding hyper-realism.<br><br>This painting is privately held by the artist's nephew.

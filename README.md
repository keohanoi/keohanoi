        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">After completing works for the archbishop of Pittsburgh in Parma, Italy, Cassatt, traveled to Spain, where she lived for a few months. She first copied the Spanish masters in Madrid, and worked in a studio in Seville. She made many paintings, such as Spanish Dancer Wearing a Lace Mantilla, which illustrated the beauty and style of the local Spanish women. This painting was first exhibited at the Paris Salon in 1874, in which it was entitled “Ida,” and attracted the attention of Edgar Degas. Cassatt and Degas would later have a fruitful career together, as fellow painters exhibiting at the Impressionist Salons. </span>

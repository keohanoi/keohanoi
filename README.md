        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">This work is part of Krasner’s Little Image series of the late 1940s, which she began soon after she and her husband, Jackson Pollock, moved from New York City to Springs, New York, on Long Island. Working in a small bedroom she used as her studio, she applied thick paint—sometimes directly from the tube—in rhythmic and repetitive strokes, giving equal attention to every inch of the canvas. Like many of her peers, Krasner invented a language of private symbols that implied but did not specify meaning.</span>

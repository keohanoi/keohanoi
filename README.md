        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">In Metamorphoses, Ovid recounts the Roman myth of the mortal Aglauros. According to the story, the god Mercury falls in love with Aglauros’s sister Herse and offers Aglauros gold to bring him to her. Poisoned with jealousy by the goddess Minerva, Aglauros refuses. Here Fabritius depicts the moment just before Mercury turns Aglauros to stone. A student of Rembrandt, Fabritius’s dramatic lighting and very human portrayal reflect his teacher’s influence.</span>

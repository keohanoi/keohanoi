        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">The painting depicts the famous boxing match that took place on September 14, 1923 between the boxer Jack Dempsey (depicted in white shorts) and his Argentinean rival, Luis Angel Firpo (in purple shorts). Firpo knocks his opponent out of the ring here, but, in reality, Dempsey won the match. Bellows is noted for the high contrasts and for the angle that places the viewer in the audience. The balding man at the far left of the picture represents Bellows himself.</span>

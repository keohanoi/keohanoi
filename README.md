        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">Israel Tsvaygenbaum was always fascinated with Moses in the Bible and his tremendous role in Jewish history. He always had an inclination to create a painting about Moses and his relationship with his people, who occasionally challenged and disappointed him with their behavior. The masks represent all our weakness. In the painting, Moses is turned to stone when he saw that his people built a golden calf to worship instead of worshiping God who saved them from slavery and that they too, sin. The painting “Moses and the Masks” is a reflection of complexity of human beings.</span>

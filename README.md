      <p class="description">
        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">Diez, who was Schönberg’s student, wrote in a letter  that this was one of two portraits that Gerstl painted of him in 1906, almost certainly after Diez had returned that autumn from a summer placement in Rome . Diez claims that the portrait was originally intended to be a commission, organised by Schönberg, who had apparently decided to help Gerstl obtain work amongst his circle. Diez recalls that the work was painted in a temporary studio, whose description matches one above Café Sperl at Gumpendorferstraße 11, Vienna VI that may have been one that Gerstl occupied at the time.</span>

        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">The Loves of Paris and Helen is a 1788 painting by <a target="_blank" href="/en/jacques-louis-david">Jacques-Louis David</a>, showing Helen of Troy and Paris from Homer's Iliad. It is now in the Louvre Museum.
<br>
<br>It was the result of a commission from the comte d'Artois. It shows David in his 'galante' phase and was interpreted as a satire on the manners of the comte d'Artois. The caryatids in the background are copies of those by Jean Goujon in the Louvre.</span>

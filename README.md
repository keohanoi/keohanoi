        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">This painting is among Jacopo’s boldest compositions. As an example of how he experimented with linear perspective, he had positioned the cross at an angle, rather than frontally. In addition, the soldier and a few of the viewers have their backs turned to the viewer, lending the feeling of intimacy, and that the viewer is part of the crowd as well. Jacopo Bellini’s influence on art was further expanded through his two sons and his son in law, who were all successful artists of their time. </span>

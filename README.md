        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">Repin’s first widely recognized work after graduation from art school, Barge Haulers on the Volga was immediately praised by critics. Although its social message was crystal clear in its portrayal of the inhumane working conditions faced by the barge haulers, the work was bought by the Emperor’s second son, Grand Duke Vladimir Alexandrovich, and exhibited all throughout Europe as an example of Russian realist painting. The work was wildly popular, and it has been parodied throughout Russia, and used as the basis for political cartoons. It was also the inspiration for the popular Russian song “The Song of the Volga Boatmen.”</span>

        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">Two of the works that foreshadow Filonov’s development of his analytical method are Peasant Family and Heads, both created in 1910. In Heads, the figures are depicted in various scales, interweaving with one another in a supernatural unity. His unusual portrayals of figures raised the ire in his fellow students and professors at the Academy of Arts. Although they did represent the full likenesses of the individual, they were produced in garish colors and did not conform to the standards of the academy. It was for works such as this that Filonov was dismissed from the Academy in 1910. </span>

        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">This works title resembles the greek myth of Ariadne, which tells that Theseus was determined to defeat the monster Minotaurus, that lived in the middle of a labyrinth that was impossible to get out. So Ariadne, in love with Theseus, gave him a ball of thread so he could find the way out.<br> As in the myth, the painting is composed by a labyrinth, thin lines cross an apparently vast space, painted with light blue and grey colors that give a cold impression to the viewer. It is the labyrinth of death, that is just around the corner since we can´t get out of it. This was one of Vieira´s last paintings, and as she was old, she thought more about death and spirituality, and so her works became more focused in those themes. The artist would eventually die just four years later.</span>

        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">The painting “The Angel of Roses” is tribute to a new life. The artist Israel Tsvaygenbaum thinks that during development of a new life inside a mother’s womb, there exists an angel who is watching over the child in the garden of roses. In the artist mind an internal life of women is composed of a colorful paradise; a beautiful garden of roses with butterflies. In a dream, the artist found these spectra of colors with the angel who cherished the child inside the rose. The artist lived with the thoughts about his dream over and over again until he finally depicted it in his painting.</span>

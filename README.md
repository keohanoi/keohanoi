        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">This is the first in a series of two paintings by Rubens of the same name. This particular piece was held in the Liechtenstein Collection in Vienna Austria, since the 17th century. In 1767, it was miscatalogued as a piece by one of Rubens’ students, which remained an error until 2001, when an expert art historian correctly attributed the work to Rubens, based on his similar work Samson and Delilah. It then sold at auction the next year for £49.5 million, and was later donated to The Art Gallery of Ontario, inn Toronto Canada. </span>

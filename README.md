        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">In mythology, the eagle is linked with the sun. Its power, strength and radiance moreover make it the world's most important emblem, after the lion. Majestic, proud and mighty; it circles in the sky. The eagle not only rules the air, but is also a very special animal. This symbolism is also expressed in the work of Gazmend Freitag.</span>

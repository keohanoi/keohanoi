        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">‘Ephemerides’ are tables used by astronomers and navigators giving the position of comets, asteroids and planets at a given date. The circles in the horizontal panel dividing the composition suggest the orbits delineated by these astronomical charts. Although made nearly three decades after CoBrA disbanded, the organic forms and strange, dancing creatures evoked here recall the motifs and unrestrained energy of CoBrA art. The red calligraphic signature indicates Alechinsky’s debt to Japanese art and calligraphy.</span>

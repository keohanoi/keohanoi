        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">This fine painting by the École de Paris artist Jacob Macznik reveals his skillful use of light and of color, particularly green.  While daytime, there are few and mild shadows and the grass is not bright, suggesting the sky may have been overcast.  The red-brown coloration of the cows appears natural and realistic, even vivid against the variably green grass.  We hardly notice the ample use of green on their hides!  Despite being counterfactual, of course, the coloring of the cows nonetheless visually works beautifully well in the painting.<br><br>This painting is privately held by the artist's nephew.

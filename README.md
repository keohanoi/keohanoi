This is the first painting I did under the influence of my copy of the Medusa. … With this painting I am making a start with a new method which consists of placing the copy next to the work I am painting, in an attempt to check the accuracy of the colour. The Head of Medusa helps me to do what's correct. Accurate imitation of the tones leads to the style of painting that was predominant from the 5th and 4th century BC onwards.'

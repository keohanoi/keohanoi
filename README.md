        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">More properly known as Blue Poles: Number 11, 1952, this painting is considered Pollock’s most important work. In 1973, it was purchased at auction for $2 million dollars, which at the time was the highest price ever paid for a painting at auction. At the time of sale the art world was typified by a conservative climate, and the high purchase price, as well as the painting itself, created a political and media scandal, which was capitalized upon by the National Gallery of Australia, who bought the painting. It is now one of the most popular exhibits at the Gallery, and has risen in price to an estimated $180 million. </span>

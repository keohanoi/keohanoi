        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">This artwork began in Boipeba, Bahia, Brazil and was completed in London, UK. It marks the beginning of an new era for Tercio. Since then the artist has embarked on a completely new cycle of work with radical technical changes.
<br>
<br>The Hyena Aunt is the left panel of the triptych.His own aunt is depicted with hyena arms and golden bracelets further exposing her attachments. Strong matriarchal powers can destroy the psychic of others. This artwork represents a sense of utter despair of a mother on the verge of losing her two sons.

        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">'Nexus' means connection or link. The painting, made in 1959, marks the transition between two series of important paintings by Morris Louis, who created a new style of Abstract Expressionism in the last five years of his short life. The style was later called Post-painterly Abstraction by the critic Clement Greenberg. In Nexus II, plain fields of colour are pushed to the sides. Thin washes of denim blue on the left and jade green on the right are separated by an off-white panel. The effect of harmonious, even blissful, colour is intensified by the simplicity of means the artist uses, and the large size of the work.</span>

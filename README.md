        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">The Equestrian Portrait of Philip III is a portrait of Philip III of Spain on horseback by <a target="_blank" href="/en/diego-velazquez">Diego Velázquez</a>. It was painted in 1634/35, some years after the subject's death, as part of a series of paintings of the royal family. Intended to be displayed in the Hall of Realms at the Palacio del Buen Retiro in Madrid, it is now in the Prado Museum.
<br>
<br>The studio of the artist is believed to have made a significant contribution to the painting.
<br>
<br>The equestrian portrait of Philip III was commissioned by his son Philip IV. It was painted for the decoration of the Hall of Realms of the Buen Retiro Palace, along with the equestrian portraits of Phillip III's wife, Queen Margaret, Philip IV, Isabella of France, and Prince Baltasar Carlos.</span>

The painting refers to the biblical story of Jacob, who crossed the river Jabbok and spent the night wrestling a mysterious angel. The artist depicts the subject indirectly, showing a group of Breton women after a sermon in church. The women moved by the sermon see a vision of Jacob wrestling the angel.<br><br>The available information about the painting comes primarily from two sources: letters written by Gauguin and writings by <a target="_blank" href="https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/post-impressionism">Post-Impressionist</a> artist <a target="_blank" href="https://www.wikiart.org/en/emile-bernard">Emile Bernard</a>. Bernard spent the summer of 1888 with Gauguin in Pont-Aven – the two worked side by side, and while Gauguin painted <i>Vision After the Sermon</i> Bernard worked on the painting <a target="_blank" href="https://www.wikiart.org/en/emile-bernard/breton-women-in-the-meadow-1888"><i>Breton Women in the Meadow</i></a> (1888). The two paintings share stylistic similarities and are both examples of <a target="_blank" href="https://www.wikiart.org/en/paintings-by-style/cloisonnism">Cloisonnism</a> – a post-impressionist style characterized by bold flat forms enclosed by dark outlines. Both artists also shared an affinity for Japanese art, and Bernard wrote that the motif of <i>Jacob wrestling the angel in Vision After the Sermon</i> was modeled after <a target="_blank" href="https://www.wikiart.org/en/katsushika-hokusai">Hokusai</a>’s <a target="_blank" href="https://www.wikiart.org/en/katsushika-hokusai/all-works#!#filterName:Theme_sumo-wrestlers,resultType:masonry">Sumo Wrestlers</a>.<br><br>Gauguin used the term <a target="_blank" href="https://www.wikiart.org/en/paintings-by-style/synthetism">Synthetism</a> to describe paintings such as <i>Vision After the Sermon</i>, in which he aimed to synthesize between the outward appearance of the subject, the artist’s emotional response to the subject, and the aesthetic considerations of line, form, and color. In <i>Vision After the Sermon</i>, Gauguin creates a synthesis between two realities: the everyday life of the Breton women and their vision of the biblical event. In a letter to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.wikiart.org/en/vincent-van-gogh">Vincent Van Gogh</a>, he wrote about the sermon that inspired the painting: “For me, the landscape and the fight only exist in the imagination of the people praying after the sermon which is why there is a contrast between the life-size people and the struggle in its non-natural disproportionate landscape”. For this reason, Gauguin emphasized the contrast between the dramatic fight scene and the serenity of the women quietly praying.<br><br>By weaving together different Christian symbols, Gauguin added new content and meaning to the religious subject. In the foreground, he depicted twelve Breton women in prayer, a symbolic reference to Jacob’s twelve sons, the predecessors of the twelve tribes of Israel. The apple tree in the center of the composition was another non-traditional addition to the story of Jacob. In the bible, the apple tree is a symbol of knowledge, a reference to man’s awakening, and subsequently his fall from grace. In <i>Vision After the Sermon</i>, the apple tree is full and lush, suggesting the possibility of man’s redemption and a possible return to paradise. Another important component is the bull emerging from the left corner of the painting. The bull is possibly a sacrificial animal, and as such, it can hint to the sacrifice of Christ and the chance for redemption. The bull is also connected to Breton, it is a symbol attributed to four Breton saints. In this way, Gauguin formed a connection between his unique symbolism and the spirituality of the devout Breton women.</span>

        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">The Assumption of the Virgin Mary or Assumption of the Holy Virgin, is a painting by <a target="_blank" href="/en/peter-paul-rubens">Peter Paul Rubens</a>, completed in 1626 as an altarpiece for the high altar of the Cathedral of Our Lady, Antwerp, where it remains.
<br>
<br>In Rubens' depiction of the Assumption of Mary, a choir of angels lifts her in a spiraling motion toward a burst of divine light. Around her tomb are gathered the 12 apostles — some with their arms raised in awe; others reaching to touch her discarded shroud. The women in the painting are thought to be Mary Magdalene and the Virgin Mary's two sisters. A kneeling woman holds a flower, referring to the lilies that miraculously filled the empty coffin.
<br>
<br>The Antwerp Cathedral of Our Lady opened a competition for an Assumption altar in 1611. Rubens submitted models to the clergy on February 16, 1611. In September 1626, 15 years later, he completed the piece.
<br>
<br>There is a smaller studio version, with some differences, in the National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C.
<br>
<br>Another version hangs on the right side altar of the castle church St. Peter and Paul in Kirchheim in Schwaben, Germany.</span>

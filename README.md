      <p class="description">
        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">In this significant piece from her later career, Cassatt decided to depict a solitary young girl within the confines of a domestic setting. The Impressionist style is evident in the discernible brushwork and casual posture of the figure. The composition's asymmetry, elevated perspective, limited depth, and abrupt cropping of the scene indicate the influence of Japanese art. Cassatt's own insightful observations inform the construction of this image. The child, who was the offspring of one of Degas' acquaintances, is seated in an unconstrained manner that conveys her youthfulness. The way she is overwhelmed by the adult furnishings around her highlights the discomfort and isolation that sometimes accompany certain stages of childhood.</span>

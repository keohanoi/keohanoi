        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">Jason and Medea is an <a target="_blank" href="/en/paintings-by-media/oil-on-sacking">oil painting</a> in the Pre-Raphaelite style created by <a target="_blank" href="/en/john-william-waterhouse">John William Waterhouse</a> in 1907.
<br>
<br>The painting depicts the Colchian princess, Medea, preparing a magic potion for Jason to enable him to complete the tasks set for him by her father, Aeëtes.
<br>
<br>Medea's determined facial expression shows a characterization consistent with that of Greek literature, particularly Euripides' tragedy Medea.
<br>
<br>The painting is thematically and visually similar to Waterhouse's The Magic Circle.</span>

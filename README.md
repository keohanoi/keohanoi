        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe"><i>Infinity Room</i> is an "infinity environment" created by Doug Wheeler. It consists of an all-white room with round corners, using saturated light and space in a way that removes visual reference points for the viewer. The lightning is programmed to have a 32 minutes cycle switching from dark blue to intense white and vice versa, evoking a day-into-night-into-day cycle. It was hosted in David Zwirner Gallery, New York.</span>

        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">In 2006 painter Lisa Adams, moving her long time Mar Vista studio, gave Hinnebusch 10 large paintings on wood panel and plywood. "Twiga Lady" was the left side of a two sided diptych, secured with a long hinge. HInnebusch took the blue circles against the black background and painted it into the head of a figure holding a guitar.  The body of the woman is a collage of photographs of Hinnebusch model Krishena. Also blue and aluminium tape.

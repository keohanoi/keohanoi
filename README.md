        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">Point of Tranquility is an example of Louis' Floral Veils, the last series he completed before embarking on the Unfurleds. Louis created the Florals by turning the canvas as he poured the paint, as opposed to working from a single vantage point. Louis layers the acrylic in a pattern that suggests a flower, the bleeding pigment creating a muddled, washy surface at the center of the canvas. The "veils" are apparent in the overlap of pigment, where washes both obscure and reveal layers of thinned color. </span>

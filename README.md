It is now held in the Galleria Palatina of the Palazzo Pitti in Florence. It also features in the 1772 painting The Tribuna of the Uffizi by Zoffany.<br>
<br>
<br>Beginning from left to right it shows Peter Paul, Philip Rubens (the painter's brother), Justus Lipsius, and Joannes Woverius. In the background is Peter Paul's bust of Seneca, now believed to be a copy of an imaginary Hellenistic portrait of the Greek poet Hesiod. <br></span>

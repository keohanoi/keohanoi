        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">Among the works exhibited at the 1997 Venice Biennial was a long table with 13 books, titled "The Banquet", which immediately makes you think of Plato and his dialogue on love. But at the same time, the table in itself, the number of books and their biblical sizes remind the viewer of The Last Supper and the Christian concept of love. The artist establishes a conceptual continuity between Greek philosophy and Christian Orthodox dogma. Bitzan says this piece "reminds us of our solid cultural tradition." (Anca Ionita)</span>

        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe"><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onya_La_Tour">Onya La Tour</a>  was an artist's model as well as an art collector and dealer. She was a friend and avid collector of Burliuk's paintings, having about <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onya_La_Tour#Exhibitions_During_La_Tour's_Lifetime">100 of his works in 1940</a>. As can be seen by comparison with photographic portraits, this portrait is one of the most realistic likenesses of La Tour, among a large number of paintings depicting her. This portrait is signed "Burliuk" at the lower right just after the "by -" in brown ink script, which has faded to near invisibility. The title and year were apparently added later in black ink by La Tour. Eric would very much like to be in touch with the heirs of Burliuk to obtain permission to include this portrait in Wikipedia/Wikimedia. He can be emailed at yahoo, surnameFirstname, no space.</span>

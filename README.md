Since 2015 The Passenger has become part of the city center. Arne Quinze recently stopped by: <br><br><i>"I am delighted to see how people find peace and time for contemplation under the wings of this work. We humans have managed to cover a big part of our planet with concrete. We built very monotonous cities and we've never been as far from nature as we are today. I hope that the confrontation between the public and my sculptures will lead to people allowing more colour and nature in our cities."</i></span>

        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">The Apollo Belvedere (also called the Pythian Apollo or Apollo of the Belvedere) is a celebrated <a target="_blank" href="/en/paintings-by-media/marblemedium-qs-p186-q40861-0">marble</a> sculpture from Classical Antiquity.  <br>
<br>
<br>The Apollo is now thought to be an original Roman re-creation of Hadrianic date (ca. 120–140). The distinctively Roman foot-wear is one reason scholars believe it is not a copy of an original Greek statue. It was rediscovered in central Italy in the late 15th century during the Italian Renaissance and was placed on semi-public display in the Vatican Palace in 1511, where it remains. It is now in the Cortile del Belvedere of the Pio-Clementine Museum of the Vatican Museums complex.<br>
<br>
<br>From the mid-18th century it was considered the greatest ancient sculpture by ardent <a target="_blank" href="/en/artists-by-art-movement/neoclassicism">neoclassicists</a>, and for centuries it epitomized the ideals of aesthetic perfection for Europeans and westernized parts of the world.<br>
<br>
<br>The Greek god Apollo is depicted as a standing archer having just shot an arrow. Although there is no agreement as to the precise narrative detail being depicted, the conventional view has been that he has just slain the serpent Python, the chthonic serpent guarding Delphi—making the sculpture a Pythian Apollo. Alternatively, it may be the slaying of the giant Tityos, who threatened his mother Leto, or the episode of the Niobids.<br>
<br>
<br>The large white marble sculpture is 2.24 m (7.3&nbsp;feet) high. Its complex contrapposto has been much admired, appearing to position the figure both frontally and in profile. The arrow has just left Apollo's bow and the effort impressed on his musculature still lingers. His hair, lightly curled, flows in ringlets down his neck and rises gracefully to the summit of his head, which is encircled with the strophium, a band symbolic of gods and kings. His quiver is suspended across his left shoulder. He is entirely nude except for his sandals and a robe (chlamys) clasped at his right shoulder, turned up on his left arm, and thrown back.<br>
<br>
<br>The lower part of the right arm and the left hand were missing when discovered and were restored by Giovanni Angelo Montorsoli (1507–1563), a sculptor and pupil of <a target="_blank" href="/en/michelangelo">Michelangelo</a>.<br>
<br>
<br>Before its installation in the Cortile delle Statue of the Belvedere palace in the Vatican, the Apollo—which seems to have been discovered in 1489 in the present territory of Anzio (at that time territory of Nettuno), or perhaps at Grottaferrata where Giuliano della Rovere was abbot in commendam—apparently received very little notice from artists. It was, however, sketched twice during the last decade of the 15th century in the book of drawings by a pupil of <a target="_blank" href="/en/domenico-ghirlandaio">Domenico Ghirlandaio</a>, now at the Escorial. Though it has always been known to have belonged to Giuliano della Rovere before he became pope, as Julius II, its placement has been confused until as recently as 1986: Cardinal della Rovere, who held the titulus of San Pietro in Vincoli, stayed away from Rome for the decade during Alexander VI's papacy (1494–1503); in the interim, the Apollo stood in his garden at SS. Apostoli, Deborah Brown has shown, and not at his titular church, as had been assumed.<br></span>

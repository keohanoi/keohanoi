        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">This work was part of a much larger painting titled <i>The Advent of the Mechanical Man</i>. It was cut down by the artist at some point. Another section still exists, carrying the original title of  <i>The Advent of the Mechanical Man</i>. It is unclear why the artist changed the date on this portion of the work. The work is an example of Burliuk's Radio-style, described in the Radio-style manifestos published in 1926 and 1927. https://georgefiskcomfortsociety.wordpress.com/2020/11/29/radio-epoch-and-radio-style-is-our-present/</span>

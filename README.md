        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">Warhol created several notable works in the early 1960s. This began with the famous Campbell's Soup Cans, which was completed between 1961 and early 1962.[2] During this period, Warhol experimented with numerous common items, before creating the Green Coca-Cola Bottles painting in 1962. This period is often referred back to as Warhol's earlier work.[citation needed]<br><br>In his early days as an artist, Warhol experimented with the Coca-Cola bottle beginning in the 1950s. The first known artwork of Warhol's was an ink-on-gouache drawing of a Coca-Cola bottle with a pair of legs. In the early 1960s, before the creation of Campbell's Soup Cans, he used to tear Coca-Cola bottle images from magazines to use them in collages.[3]<br><br>This inspiration and early use of the Coca-Cola bottle led him to create Green Coca-Cola Bottles in 1962.[3]<br><br>Green Coca-Cola Bottles took a mainstream item and converted it into a piece of art. Warhol’s piece utilized a silkscreen technique, which mechanicalized some aspects of the painting but featured individualized “unevenness” across the painting. The painting engenders an optimistic message for the American public, described in Warhol’s own words, “What’s grand about this country is that America started the tradition where the richest consumers buy essentially the same thing as the poorest... you can know that the President drinks Coke, Liz Taylor drinks Coke, and, just think, you can drink Coke, too. A Coke is a Coke, and no amount of money can get you a better Coke.”[4]</span>

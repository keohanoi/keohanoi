        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">This work shows a young man rowing a boat down a tree-lined river, towards a ghostly white palace in the sky; on the shore to the left, a guardian angel watches over him, offering him protection on his journey. This artwork is the second in <a target="_blank" href="https://www.wikiart.org/en/thomas-cole/all-works#!#filterName:Series_the-voyage-of-life,resultType:masonry"><i>Voyage of Life</i></a>, a series of four paintings completed by Cole during 1842 which depict the various stage of man's allegorical journey through life. The other three represent childhood, manhood, and old age, with compositional elements and motifs such as the boat, the river, and the angel recurring throughout. The four stages of human life are reflected in the passage of the seasons across the paintings, nature serving as a mirror for man's emotional condition, in quintessential <a target="_blank" href="https://www.wikiart.org/en/paintings-by-style/romanticism">Romantic</a> style.<br><br>The <i>Voyage of Life</i> was commissioned by the banker Samuel Ward and was meant to remind the viewer of the course that must be steered to secure a resting place in eternity. In so doing, these works tap into the cultural mood in America during the 1840s, when a period of intense religious revivalism was underway. At the same time, the 'voyage of life' may be read as an allegory for the progress of American civilization, which was, at this time, in a promising but uncertain stage of its growth. The compositional style exemplifies Cole's approach in combining rugged, American-style landscapes with motifs and techniques borrowed from European landscape painting in both the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.wikiart.org/en/paintings-by-style/neoclassicism">Neoclassical</a> and Romantic styles.<br><br> The <i>Voyage of Life</i> paintings were so popular that they became a source of dispute between Cole, who wanted to keep them on public display, and his patron Samuel Ward, who tried to keep them for his private collection, refusing to sell the paintings back to the artist. In the end, Cole created a second version of the series while visiting Europe in 1842. On a personal note, he had converted to the Episcopal Church in 1941, and these paintings are the best example of the religiously allegorical work which he produced during the last years of his life. </span>

        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">Siberechts painted the present painting in 1692, by which stage he had been living and working in England for many years. This painting is however dramatically different from his usual work of this period. Instead it follows in the tradition of the landscapes from his later Flemish period, which he occasionally still produced. By comparing A Horse-Drawn Cart with Two Women Travelling down a Flooded Road at the Edge of a Wood to a painting from his Flemish period, such as Peasants Crossing a Stream, which was executed over twenty years earlier, it becomes apparent that Siberechts has adopted the manner and style of the earlier work in the present painting. Both paintings have a stretch of water in the foreground on which Siberechts has indulged a clear interest in the glittering effects of light off the water’s surface. In both works the dominant figures are female, and the inclusion of cattle wading through the water are a prominent feature. The employment of the expanding distant landscape which leads our eye deep into the background of the work, is again a technique apparent in both paintings.</span>

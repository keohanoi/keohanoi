        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">Goya's relationships with members of Spain's social elite were a subject of scandal and rumor, particularly his suspected love affair with the aristocratic Maria Cayetana de Silva, the 13th Duchess of Alba. After the Duke of Alba's death in 1796, Goya likely became involved with the Duchess, who was known for her beauty, curvaceous figure, alabaster complexion, and voluminous black curls. In this portrait, painted the year after the Duke's death, the Duchess poses in mourning black as a maja, a member of Spain's lower classes known for their bold behavior. She points toward the ground, where Goya has lightly drawn his name in the sand. When the painting was restored, the word "solo" was uncovered next to Goya's name, suggesting that he was her only love. Although the painting was commissioned by the Duchess, Goya kept it in his possession for 15 years, indicating his strong attachment to the work and its subject. Art historians speculate that the end of their affair may have led to the imagery that would populate Goya's later works, depicting women as fickle temptresses, men as cuckolded fools, and lovers tortured by uncontrollable passions.</span>

        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">In addition to this painting of Diego Rivera, a famous muralist, Modigliani painted many portraits of his peers, including Pablo Picasso, Juan Gris, Max Jacob, and Chaim Soutine, among others influential philosophers and thinkers of his time. Strangely, this painting deviates from Modigliani’s norms of elongated features and simple forms. There is a great amount of texture on Rivera’s face, which is the most complete area of the painting, the lines and strokes fading away as you get farther from the face. Rivera seems to be amusedly sitting for the painter, who with quick brush strokes, is quickly capturing his form. </span>

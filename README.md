        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">The Annunciation is a painting created by Italian Renaissance painter <a target="_blank" href="/en/sandro-botticelli">Sandro Botticelli</a>. It is a tempera on panel and measures 49.5&nbsp;cm tall and 58.5&nbsp;cm wide. It is in the Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum in Glasgow, Scotland.
<br>
<br>Its date is not certain though a majority of the critics consider it early, noticing certain elements reminiscent of <a target="_blank" href="/en/andrea-del-verrocchio">Verrocchio</a>. Van Marle, however, dates it circa 1490.
<br>
<br>On the lower part there is a note that indicates that it came from the Florentine Church of Saint Barnabas.
<br>
<br>The atmosphere is achieved through the succession of columns and sections of flooring that serve to demonstrate the perspective. The solemn architecture overlooks the figures.</span>

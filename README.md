        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe"> The pottery objects in this painting have been depicted from different viewpoints depending on their situation in the overall composition. Thus those near the bottom of the image are painted as though seen from a point somewhere above, those near the centre appear to be viewed from eye level and those towards the top of the canvas are shown from below. This device emphasises the overall effect of the stacking up of a large number of similar objects. The simple black outlines and strong colours are characteristic of much of Caulfield's work. The artist has written of this painting that it 'was an excuse for me to use a lot of colour'.</span>

        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">Delta Theta is a classic work from the Unfurled series, which are the most recognizable of Louis' oeuvre. Louis folded the massive canvas(almost 20 feet wide) before pouring the thinned acrylic, which soaks into the weave of the fabric in rainbows of color. Louis' work challenged the notion of "completion," as he tended to leave large areas of the canvas untreated. Incorporating raw canvas into the final composition was a signature of the Color Field painters. </span>

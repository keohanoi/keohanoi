        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">"It is permissible to suppose that <i>Organic Form</i> depicts an altar. A vertical, creased 'cloth of honor' hangs behind, and the cross (however much it resembles a sword hilt) may be a crucifix. The mystery rests with the 'organic form' itself, which emanates from the cross, and seems to embody processes of birth, growth, and transformation. Is it possible to identify a bird, the dove of the Holy Spirit, in the center? Since 1955 Sutherland had been resident in Menton in the south of France. Here his focus switched from the British landscape to prolific exercises in still life (whether animal, vegetable or mineral), a repertoire of images and forms which he surely harvested when painting <i>Organic Form</i>."</span>

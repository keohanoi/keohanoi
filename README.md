        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">Susanna and the Elders is a 1610-1 painting by the Italian artist <a target="_blank" href="/en/artemisia-gentileschi">Artemisia Gentileschi</a>. It currently hangs in the Schloss Weißenstein collection, in Pommersfelden, Germany.
<br>
<br>It depicts the story of Susanna from the Book of Daniel. In the story, two elders threaten to testify that Susanna was alone with a young man in her garden, which she was not, unless she has sex with them. Some other depictions of Susanna include Susanna and the Elders by <a target="_blank" href="/en/tintoretto">Tintoretto</a>, Susanna and the Elders by Rembrandt, and Susanna and the Elders by <a target="_blank" href="/en/peter-paul-rubens">Peter Paul Rubens</a>. It is only one of the multiple paintings Artemisia Gentileschi made to represent the story.</span>

<br>
<br>The main figure in the painting was long thought to be Saint Eligius, the patron saint of goldsmiths, due to the presence of a halo. In 1993 the halo was recognized as a later addition and removed. The Ducht art histocian Hugo van der Velden thinks the main figure may be the famous goldsmith Willem van Vleuten, who by then lived in Bruges.</span>

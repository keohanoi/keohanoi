Paul Getty Museum. It was a commission by count Franz Erwein von Schonborn-Wiesentheid during David's exile in Brussels. It shows Telemachus and Eucharis, two characters in Fénelon's novel Les Aventures de Télémaque, inspired by Homer's Odyssey. It was the artist's last painting to show a couple from mythology, it was a pendant painting to his Love and Psyche.</span>

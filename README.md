He listens to Hermes, standing to his right, who has brought the three goddesses to him to be judged. Aphrodite, accompanied by Eros is in the upper left, seated beside a large box, holding a wreath and a mirror. Hera, holding her scepter is seated in the upper right on a rock. Athena, directly below Paris, is also seated, leaning on her shield, wearing her helmet and holding a large phiale. Athena is attended by two youths, who, like Paris, are in Eastern costume. In the same register, at the extreme left, a young Pan, leaning on a rock, observes the scene. On the neck: frontal head of a woman wearing a Phrygian cap emerging from a blossom, surrounded by flowers and tendrils. On the handles, in relief, heads of Io with blonde hair. <br><br><i>Reverse: naiskos with a statue of the deceased woman holding a wreath, a long sash, and a flower.</i> Around the naiskos four mourners. Above, on either side is a seated youth holding a box; the one on the left also holds grapes. The other, a situla. Below, also arranged symetrically, a woman approaches on eighter side, holding a mirror and an oinochoe. On the handles in relief, heads of Io with black hair.<br><br>Attributed to the Baltimore Painter<br><br><a target="_blank" href="https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/255282">The Met</a></span>

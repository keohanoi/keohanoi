        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">Louis Van Lint’s work is deeply rooted in the observation of nature. In all seasons he will register field experiences in drawings where organic forms are restructured in dynamic compositions. ‘Red Composition’ expresses this vibration of form and color in a rhythmic progression on the darkening red background. It glorifies the resonance of the artist’s dynamic interaction with nature.</span>

        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">Summer's Day is a painting by French <a target="_blank" href="/en/artists-by-art-movement/impressionism">Impressionist</a> painter <a target="_blank" href="/en/berthe-morisot">Berthe Morisot</a>. The painting depicts two women seated in a row boat, and was painted in the Bois de Boulogne. It is currently held by the National Gallery, having been donated by Hugh Lane. The painting was stolen from the Tate by two Irish students while it was on display there in order to protest the Lane Bequest. It was later returned after being left anonymously at the Irish Embassy.

<br>Morisot employed a rather unusual palette in this painting. She painted the dark blue coat of the woman on the right with cerulean blue which was rarely used by the Impressionists. The green foliage is painted in a mixture of emerald green, viridian, lead white and cadmium yellow. Cadmium yellow was not yet widely used at this time.</span>

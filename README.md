      <p class="description">
        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">The Riga Episode is a very intense dialogue with a sensitivity that pervades the city and the people who live along this superior border of Europe. Here everything seems rarefied and clearer at the same time. The spaces between houses, between people, allow seeing better many dynamics of the present. Riga is a quite silent city. Everything seems just evident in the shape of things. The main topic of this work is the sense of fading. A common sensitivity for the entire continent, that here is particularly sharp. The premises of the former textile factory Boļševička are transformed by the artist into a proletarian compound, one of the many that had been built in the past and that now look deserted, even if there is life behind the closed doors and windows. There are many pieces of evidence of human presence, but no man or woman or child is visible, they just seem vanished. The artist starts from this invisibility, this distance, this separation that breaks up the idea of the State as a public body, to reflect upon the awareness of being a society working together to build a future, a perspective. The work is pervaded by a glacial sense of loneliness and fear. And the path of the visitor looks like a journey into what remains of a dream of a dead man.</span>

        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">"With this large composition made in Rome in 1917, Picasso takes full advantage of the aesthetic of collage, characteristic of late Cubism. Flat and geometric forms seem to be superimposed onto each other, as if they were underscored by the cut-outs of blue, grey, black and white and stippled surfaces. The overall effect is of a meticulous cut-out that is brought to life by some more realistic elements that are not devoid of humour, like the lady's necklace and her pointed nose. This composition also has a decidedly decorative dimension, reminding us of the painter's collaboration at the time with the Ballets Russes for the curtain and décors of Parade."</span>

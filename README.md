        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">Mondrian also experimented with other art forms before settling on his own neo-plastic form, including post-impressionism, pointillism, and cubism, the latter of which this is an example. This piece contains interlocking blocks, which form together in the shape of a tree. But unlike cubist artists from whom he took his cue, such as Picasso and Georges Braque, Mondrian had yet to merge his artistic style with his spiritual pursuits, and as such this was only one of a few of such cubist experiments. Mondrian still had a few years to go before he would begin to fins his real voice as an artist, although one could argue that his style was ever-changing, culminating in his masterpieces in his later years of life. </span>

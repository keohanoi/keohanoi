        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">Bathing of a Red Horse caused Petrov-Vodkin to catapult into fame and the public sphere, causing much artistic discussion about his paintings. Art connoisseurs, who were already at this time used to the striking color palettes and expressiveness of the futurists, were surprised at the artist’s different composition and the feeling of overt tension. This painting soon became his most iconic work, and was a trademark style of the artist. It also represents his attempt to synthesize Eastern and Western art, with elements of traditional Russian icons, Italian frescoes, and neoclassical trends. </span>

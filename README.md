        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">The Presentation at the Temple is a painting of the Presentation of Jesus at the Temple by the Italian master <a target="_blank" href="/en/giovanni-bellini">Giovanni Bellini</a>, dating to c. 1460. It is housed in the Fondazione Querini Stampalia, in Venice, Italy.
<br>
<br>The dating of the work is uncertain, though it is usually considered to be subsequent to the Presentation at the Temple by <a target="_blank" href="/en/andrea-mantegna">Andrea Mantegna</a> (Berlin, c. 1455), from which Bellini took a very similar placement of the figures.
<br>
<br>The commission of the two works is unknown, as well as if the figures, as is sometimes suggested, portrayed members of the Mantegna and Bellini families.
<br>
<br>The main characters are nearly the same as those in Mantegna's work: the Virgin is holding the Child, whose feet are lying on a cushion, while the bearded figure of Simeon is coming to take him. In the front is Saint Joseph, which, according to some scholars, would be a portrait of Bellini's father, <a target="_blank" href="/en/jacopo-bellini">Jacopo</a>. On the sides the painter added two further figures, which make the picture rather crowded. Apart his father, other identifications include the author's self-portrait and Mantegna (or his brother Gentile Bellini) for the two men on the right; and Nicolosia, sister of Giovanni and Gentile, and wife of Mantegna, together with their mother Anna for the women on the left.
<br>
<br>Bellini also replaced Mantegna's bronze frame with a parapet, making the characters nearer to the observer, and omitted their haloes.</span>

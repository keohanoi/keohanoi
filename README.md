        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">Similar to his fellow Nabis artists, Bonnard preferred the use of color and decorative elements to the academic technicalities in art. He became devoted to flattening out his representations into two dimensions, and exploring the many properties of color. After he settled in Le Cannet, in Southern France, he became entranced with the seductive properties of the light there, and painted over 300 hundred works which portrayed the vibrant energy of the Southern French region. View from the Artist’s Studio was created only two years before his death, and with the nondescript pathway and colorful background displays more of an abstraction of form that his earlier works.</span>

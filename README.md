        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">This drawing is unique to the Museum's collection because, unlike the Museum's other design drawings, it depicts an individual enamel object. In fact, it is the design drawing for the Museum's plum enamel bowl, which was originally in Tiffany's personal collection. The drawing illustrates the round repoussé enamel bowl decorated with plums and leaves in naturalistic and luminous tones. Various notations on the drawing list a numerical and letter code, enamel formulas, the total number of hours required to manufacture the bowl (50), and the name Julia Munson, the head of the enamel department.</span>

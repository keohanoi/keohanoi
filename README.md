        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">The House of Culture in Mangalia was conceived by architect Nicolae Vladescu. The mural piece that adorns the front was designed by Jules Perahim, in collaboration with Mac Constantinescu. Consisting of 3.150.000 colorful pieces of mosaique (each measuring 2x2 cm) and measuring more than 300 square feet, the piece was said to be the biggest mural from a socialist Eastern Europe country. In spite of its meaning not very far from that of socialist realism, the work was criticized by dogmatists for its lack of Communist symbols (hammer, sickle, etc.), replaced by elementalism, as well as the vibrant colors and sharp corners reminiscent of modernism and of Perahim's early paintings. Apparently, the repercussions Perahim had to suffer contributed to the insatisfaction that led him to leave Romania.</span>

        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">Like many of Ernst's paintings during his Paris period (1922-1941), Ubu Imperator resembles a collage in painted form. The artist's knowledge of Freudian theories, familiarity with myth and extreme wit are reflected in this early painting, which is now considered proto-Surrealist due to its strange juxtapositions.</span>

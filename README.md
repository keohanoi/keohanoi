        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">In 2000, Marden has started the series called The Propitious Garden of Plane Image, the longest two of which measure 24 feet. References to the figure and to calligraphy (from Marden's previous series) have been replaced with sinuous abstract lines. The colours of the spectrum are laid on the canvas in a way that eludes the viewer's ability to determine which ones are above and which below. These gestural, curvilinear works serves to modify Marden’s early inquiry into formalism, flatness, and materiality.</span>

        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">The Madonna dell'Impannata is an oil on panel (158x125 cm) painting by the Italian <a target="_blank" href="/en/artists-by-art-movement/high-renaissance">High Renaissance</a> painter <a target="_blank" href="/en/raphael">Raphael</a>. It has been preserved at the Palatine Gallery in Florence.
<br>
<br><a target="_blank" href="/en/giorgio-vasari">Giorgio Vasari</a> recorded that the painting was originally commissioned to Bindo Altoviti.
<br>
<br>It portraits a very old Saint Anne who is seated and holds out to the Virgin her son. There is a Saint John seated, nude, and behind Saint Anne another female saint.
<br>
<br>Bindo sent the Madonna dell'Impannata to his palace in Florence, where the picture remained until Duke Cosimo I de' Medici confiscated it for his own chapel, newly decorated by Raphael.
<br>
<br>During the Napoleonic occupation, the painting was brought to Paris in 1799, and then returned in 1815 .</span>

        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">Doug Wheeler’s RM 669 comprises curved white walls encased by a floor and ceiling that seem to recede with every step one takes toward the square of neon light positioned on the far wall. Inside RM 699, there are no hard edges; the sides of the room waver, while the bodies of other viewers sharpen to silhouettes. To achieve these illusory effects, Wheeler employed several manipulations, including minimizing the number of visible elements within the space and using white paint on the interior surfaces to enhance the way light “paints” the room. He also defused the light so that it casts no shadow. The result is a phenomenon that overtakes the artwork’s individual components; lacking form, the materials dwindle in significance compared to the viewer’s experience.</span>

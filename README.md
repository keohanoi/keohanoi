        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">Stradela Vântului is the name of the smallest street in the coastal city of Constanța (Constantza), so small that no car can enter it (in fact, some consider it to be one of the narrowest streets in Europe). Although today it is not well-known due to lack of promotion and the fragile state of the Peninsula area, it seems to have been so in the interwar period, as it was the subject of another painter, Lucia Demedriade-Bălăcescu, as well as Constantin Piliuță. It is painted long after the painting with the same title by Demedriade-Bălăcescu, featuring two distinctive marks of Piliuță's style: the focus on lines and the airy palette, complete with light grays.</span>

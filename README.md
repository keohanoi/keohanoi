        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">This painting was exhibited in Paris at the Salon d'Automne of 1911, the Salon de la Section d'Or, 1912, and reproduced in Du "Cubisme", by Jean Metzinger and Albert Gleizes in 1912. The following year it was reproduced in Les Peintres Cubistes by Guillaume Apollinaire. The painting was also published in Arthur Jerome Eddy's Cubists and Post-impressionism, 1914, 1919, entitle The Taster. André Salmon dubbed this painting "La Joconde du Cubisme" (La Joconde Cubiste), The Mona Lisa of Cubism (Mona Lisa with a teaspoon). "Tea Time" was far more famous than any painting that Picasso and Braque had made up until this time; because Picasso and Braque, by not showing at the Salons, have actually removed themselves from the public... For most people, the idea of Cubism was actually associated with an artist like Metzinger, far more than Picasso.</span>

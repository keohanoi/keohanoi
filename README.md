It is an example of Dutch Golden Age painting and is now in the collection of the Louvre.
<br>
<br>This painting was documented by Hofstede de Groot in 1914, who wrote; "173. ST. MATTHEW THE EVANGELIST. Sm. 136; Bode 270&nbsp;; Dut. 102&nbsp;; Wb. 276&nbsp;; B.-HdG. 521. He sits behind a table with a book open before him, and gazes thoughtfully into the distance. He is turned three-quarters right, and wears a coloured cap. His left hand is at his untrimmed and tangled beard&nbsp;; his right hand, holding a pen, rests on the book. He wears a loose chestnut-brown robe. An angel with rich fair curls at the back to the left lays his right hand on the evangelist's right shoulder and speaks to him. Half-length, life size. Cf. 172 and 174-5. Signed in the right centre, "Rembrandt f. 1661 "; canvas, 38 inches by 32 inches. Mentioned by Vosmaer, pp. 361, 562&nbsp;; by Bode, pp. 523, 594&nbsp;; by Dutuit, p. 35&nbsp;; by Michel, pp. 463, 562 [361-2, 434]. Etched by Claessens in the Musée Francais&nbsp;; by Oortman in the Musée Napoléon, in Filhol, viii. 509, and Landon, ii. 57. In the Louvre, Paris, 1907 catalogue, No. 2538."
<br>
<br>Rembrandt was influenced in his arrangement with the angel acting as an assistant by an earlier work by <a target="_blank" href="/en/frans-hals">Frans Hals</a>:</span>

Man was commissioned for Montreal's Expo '67. At 65 feet tall, its one of Calder's largest sculptures. Works such as Man contributed to the proliferation of public art during the second half of the twentieth century. Such grand stabiles are dynamic works, with their arches, points, and flowing forms reaching out in multiple directions.</span>

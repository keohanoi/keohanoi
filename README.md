        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">Orange Prince (1984) is a painting by American artist Andy Warhol, of Prince, the American singer, songwriter, record producer, multi-instrumentalist, actor, and director based on an original photograph by Lynn Goldsmith. The painting is one of twelve silkscreen portraits on canvas of Prince created by Warhol in 1984. These paintings and four additional works on paper are collectively known as the Prince Series.[1] Each painting is unique and can be distinguished by colour.<br><br>Orange Prince (1984) is considered an important late work referencing Warhol's portraits from the early 1960s, of movie stars and celebrity icons, such as Marilyn Monroe, Elizabeth Taylor and Jacqueline Kennedy. Art historian and Warhol expert Thomas E. Crow believes that Warhol's portrait of Prince shows much greater freedom of expression, as in the early portraits. This is especially evident when compared to Warhol's more 'factory-line' style of portraits from the 1970s onwards, which were mainly commissions.[2]<br><br>The Warhol portraits were not commissioned by Prince, but rather were made by Warhol for his private collection. Crow believes Warhol was fascinated by Prince, a young star not in Warhol's direct circle. He says that Warhol was drawn to Prince's edgy image, which acted as inspiration for the art work:<br><br>"(Warhol's) evident fascination with Prince, known for sexual frankness in his music and an androgynous style in his clothes, make-up, and hairstyle, echoed similar traits among those he famously gathered around himself in the Factory entourage of the 1960s."[2][3]</span>

        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">The Le Mans start in its traditional form had become history. The cars were stilled lined up along the pit wall, but the drivers no longer had to run across the track. Instead, they were already sitting harnessed in their vehicles.
<br>
<br>The Porsche Type 917 racing car set new standards in 1970, fielding an air-cooled 12-cylinder mid-engine with a displacement of 4.5 litres which generated 580 horsepower.
<br>
<br>Following the near defeat in the 1969 race, Hans Herrmann and his team mate Richard Attwood gained the first overall victory this time for Porsche, followed by two other Porsche 917 vehicles. Due to the severe weather conditions, speed alone did not prove decisive, but rather, and primarily, the skill of the drivers.
<br>
<br>
<br>The then 42 year old retired from active participation in racing following this success.</span>

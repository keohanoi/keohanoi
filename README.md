        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">This painting is a technical masterpiece, notable for its remarkable accuracy of tone, detail, and proportion. The unknown female sitter is depicted leaning on a plinth that forms part of a neoclassical-style column. On the table to her left sits a statue of Minerva, the Roman goddess of wisdom, which held particular significance for Kauffman. The artist wore a belt representing the battle between Minerva and Neptune for control of Attica, using the goddess's victory as a reminder of her belief in and support for female power. The sitter, who holds a book and writing implement, is believed by some viewers to be a female intellectual of the time, possibly Catherine Macaulay or Elizabeth Montagu. She exudes confidence, empowerment, and grace, resembling a Roman goddess.<br><br>The portrait endorses the neoclassical style while celebrating the artistic skill and decorum of women. The table on the left, with its carved lion's feet, is indicative of the popular style seen throughout European arts in the eighteenth century. This style was embraced by famous architect Robert Adam and potter Josiah Wedgwood, among others, and was fueled by a contemporary fascination with all things Roman or Greek. Artists like Kauffman explored these curiosities on their European Grand Tours, positioning themselves and the unknown sitter as equals to their male counterparts, equally curious and equally artistic.</span>

        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">In 1551 or 1552 Bruegel set off on the customary northern artist’s journey to Italy, probably by way of France. From several extant paintings, drawings, and etchings, it can be deduced that he traveled beyond Naples to Sicily, possibly as far as Palermo, and that in 1553 he lived for some time in Rome, where he worked with a celebrated miniaturist, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.wikiart.org/en/giulio-clovio">Giulio Clovio</a>, an artist greatly influenced by <a target="_blank" href="https://www.wikiart.org/en/michelangelo">Michelangelo</a> and later a patron of the young <a target="_blank" href="https://www.wikiart.org/en/el-greco">El Greco</a>. The inventory of Clovio’s estate shows that he owned a number of paintings and drawings by Bruegel as well as a miniature done by the two artists in collaboration. It was in Rome in 1553 that Bruegel produced his earliest signed and dated painting, 'Landscape with Christ and the Apostles at the Sea of Tiberias'. The holy figures in this painting were probably done by <a target="_blank" href="https://www.wikiart.org/en/maarten-de-vos">Maarten de Vos</a>, a painter from Antwerp then working in Italy.</span>

        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">A limited edition giclee by Charly Palmer that truly makes a powerful statement about how society views children of color in this day and age. In this work of art a young African American boy with only a sling in his back pocket has resulted in an overwhelming show of force by the authorities. The view him as a threat only because of the skin he is in. <br><br>The boy with the sling also is a reference to the biblical story of "David" and the authorities' overwhelming show of force is a reference to "Goliath". The young child is trying defeat his own goliath, the system that devalues the lives of people of color.</span>

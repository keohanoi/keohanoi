He set the half-length figure against the backdrop of a heavy purple brown curtain shot through with dark red which powerfully complements the grey-haired head. Experience and age are reflected in the vigorous face of Liston, who had returned to Britain from the Hague to prepare for his final posting to Constantinople. The distinguished diplomat spoke ten languages fluently and had held senior appointments in Madrid, Stockholm and Washington.</span>

        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">Shikler was asked by Jacqueline Kennedy to do paintings of both her and her children. As a tribute to her fallen husband, Shikler said that his portrait of the former First Lady was not only meant to capture her beauty, but to depict ‘the haunted look in her eyes’ that was due to her husband’s violent death. Like her late husband, her portrait hangs in the White House to this day.</span>

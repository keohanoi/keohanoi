      <p class="description">
        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">Israel Tsvaygenbaum’s father was a gifted storyteller. He would often tell him about life in his hometown of Bedzin (Bendin), Poland. When his father would read him books or tell him stories, he would always describe things in great detail, which later helped artist with the subject matter for his compositions. His influence on Israel Tsvaygenbaum is tremendous. Though the painting “People of Derbent” is dedicated to the people of his birth city Derbent (a town in Southern Russia) and the surroundings do look like the city, the people were painted based on impressions that his father gave him about Jews in Poland. Much of Israel Tsvaygenbaum childhood in this city was so closely linked with his father’s stories of Poland, regardless of the difference of time, generation and culture between these two places. We can see a mixture of two lives; one of the Jews of Poland at the time of his father and the second is contemporary Derbent, two opposite worlds artist often thought about and was raised with as a child.</span>

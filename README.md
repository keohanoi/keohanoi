        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">"The Ear of Grain" is an early work in which Mir贸 demonstrates his close study of everyday objects, in some ways a by-product of study in a traditional academic setting. As a young artist, Mir贸 was influenced by the painstaking, detailed realism of the Dutch Masters. The attention he gives to objects is reflected later in the care Mir贸 takes with constructing the clean-edged, biomorphic forms of his trademark style.</span>

        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">Concert of Angels is a work of <a target="_blank" href="/en/el-greco">El Greco</a> in oil on canvas from 1608, during his last period in Toledo, Spain. It is exhibited at the National Gallery in Athens.
<br>
<br>It appears to be a working study for the Annunciation at the chapel of the Hospital de Tavera. It is not an independent composition but a study for the lower part of the whole. It shows a celestial choir of angels, some of them with their backs to the viewer. The very extended heads and the anatomy of the characters show the influence of <a target="_blank" href="/en/michelangelo">Michelangelo</a>, though there are probably retouchings by Jorge Manuel Theotocópuli, the son of the painter.</span>

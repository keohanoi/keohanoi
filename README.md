        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">It is undoubtedly the most reproduced and famous painting by Rosa Bonheur. It took her 18 months of constant work to create it, through dozens of <a target="_blank" href="https://www.wikiart.org/en/rosa-bonheur/the-horse-fair-study-1850">sketches</a>, in two final versions with very different sizes. The original one is huge and is now exposed to the Met Museum of New York. The other one is about a quarter of the size and is now in the National Gallery in London. The enormous size of the primal version was not just a technical exercise, the demonstration of the artist's ability to represent a scene down to the smallest detail. It was also an intellectual operation, as it gave the painting an epic stature, claiming that the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.wikiart.org/en/paintings-by-genre/animal-painting">animal</a> genre was of equal importance to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.wikiart.org/en/paintings-by-genre/mythological-painting">mythological</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.wikiart.org/en/paintings-by-genre/religious-painting">religious</a>, or <a target="_blank" href="https://www.wikiart.org/en/paintings-by-genre/history-painting">historical</a> genres. <br><br>Bonheur's ability to capture the raw power, beauty, and strength of the untamed animals in motion is superbly displayed in this dramatic scene. In arriving at the final scheme, the artist drew inspiration from <a target="_blank" href="https://www.wikiart.org/en/george-stubbs">George Stubbs</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.wikiart.org/en/theodore-gericault">Théodore Gericault</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.wikiart.org/en/eugene-delacroix">Eugène Delacroix</a>, and ancient Greek sculpture. She referred to <i>The Horse Fair</i> as her own <a target="_blank" href="https://www.wikiart.org/en/ancient-greek-painting/cavalry-from-the-parthenon-frieze--437"><i>Parthenon frieze</i></a> (the Parthenon featured rows of rearing writhing horses in sculpted muscular relief).</span>

        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">St. Mark Enthroned is an early painting by the Italian Renaissance artist <a target="_blank" href="/en/titian">Titian</a>, executed in 1510 or 1511, which is still in the church of Santa Maria della Salute ("Saint Mary of Health") in Venice, for which it was commissioned.
<br>
<br>The painting was commissioned as an ex voto for the plague which was in Venice at the time. It features St. Roch and St. Sebastian on the right, protectors against the disease, and, on the left, Saints Cosmas and Damian, whose role as doctors enhances the protection.
<br>
<br>St. Mark, the patron saint of the Republic of Venice, is portrayed on a high throne, surrounded by the protector saints. Like other Titian paintings from these years, it shows the influence of <a target="_blank" href="/en/giorgione">Giorgione</a>, who died young in 1510.</span>

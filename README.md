        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">During his travels from September 1905 to January 1906, Sargent journeyed through the Ottoman Levant, exploring Jerusalem, Syria, and Beirut. Sargent had been fascinated by the region for some time and had previously read extensively about its history and culture. He was likely influenced by his acquaintance with Gertrude Bell, an academic expert in Levantine archeology and Arab culture. While traveling on horseback, Sargent visited Bedouin camps in the Jordan Valley and drew inspiration from this journey for his extensive mural cycle, Triumph of Religion (1895-1916), at the Boston Public Library.<br><br>This painting captures the same realistic nuance and detail for which Sargent's portraits were known, though a more impressionistic style is evident in the treatment of the surroundings and the men's clothing. The painting features a warm color palette of saturated indigo blues, warm browns, and fuchsia tones. The men's head scarves are highlighted with white gouache, capturing the intense heat of the desert during midday.</span>

        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">As well as an accomplished painter, Pietro Longhi was also a talented draftsman. He taught drawing for much of his life, having founded an academy of drawing and engraving. He often captured his figure’s image with black chalk or pencil, and used white chalk to heighten the outline, which was a traditional Venetian drawing technique. He almost effortlessly completed his drawings, including lifelike gestures and features. Although he failed as a history painter, be excelled at drawing the everyday human figure. </span>

        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">Once falsely attributed to Raphael, Judith is Giorgione’s interpretation of the Judith and Holofernes theme. Like Giorgione’s Castelfranco Madonna, it was badly restored in the late 19th century, which distorted the image, leaving the artist’s intentions unclear. In 1893, the painting was transferred from canvas to a panel, and in 1967, it was successfully restored to its original beauty. Restoration, complete in 1971, revealed the tower and hilly landscape in the background which had previously been covered by a thick layer of varnish. The painting is now held in the Russian Hermitage Museum, which came in possession of it in 1772. </span>

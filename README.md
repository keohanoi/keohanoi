        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">The famous photo captured by Hine depicts a mechanic working in a power plant in Pennsylvania and showcases the importance of workers as valuable contributors to the industry. The photograph skillfully portrays the harmonious relationship between the mechanic and the machine, equating human strength with industrial power. By positioning the man strategically within the steam line and cylinder head curves, Hine creates a visually striking composition. The worker strikes a pose for the camera while gripping his wrench, although upon closer examination, it becomes apparent that the wrench is not completely attached to the nut.</span>

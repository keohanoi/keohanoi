        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">In this project, Allan McCollum has delivered a poignant work: Each and Every One of You, an arresting exploration of the emotional investment we all share in giving each other names. "There is a fearful void," says McCollum, "in the gap between the names we are given and the presence we have with one another." Hoping to evoke an avalanche of memory and feeling with the simplest of means, he researched the U.S. Census Bureau's most recent compilation of common names used in the U.S., and produced 3 portfolios of 1200 prints each: the 600 most common female names and the 600 most common male names. Each portfolio is ordered according to popularity into two handmade walnut boxes. Each and Every One of You was first exhibited at the Barbara Krakow Gallery in Boston, Massachusetts.</span>

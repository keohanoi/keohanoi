        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">La velata, or La donna velata ("The woman with the veil"), is one of the most famous portraits by the Italian Renaissance painter <a target="_blank" href="/en/raphael">Raphael</a>.
<br>
<br>The subject of the painting appears in another portrait, La Fornarina, and is traditionally identified as the fornarina (bakeress) Margherita Luti, Raphael's Roman mistress.
<br>
<br>As usual with Raphael, the subject's clothing is chosen and painted with close attention; here it is strikingly opulent.</span>

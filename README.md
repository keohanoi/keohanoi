        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">Bruegel made many landscape drawings during his journey to Italy between 1552 and 1555. In Antwerp the workshop of Hieronymus Cock published large prints after these drawings. The young brothers Lucas and Baptista van Doetecum , assistants in Cock's studio, were responsible for translating the drawings into prints. Only once did Bruegel taken up the etching needle himself, for this Hare Hunt.</span>

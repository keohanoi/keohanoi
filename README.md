        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">Diebenkorn's shift from abstract landscape to a more figurative style that had begun in 1954 can be seen in this painting. The artist maintained that works such as this one had been partly influenced by his friends <a target="_blank" href="https://www.wikiart.org/en/elmer-bischoff">Elmer Bischoff</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.wikiart.org/en/david-park">David Park</a>, who had turned away from landscape toward the figure. Also, Diebenkorn had been looking at the work of such European modernists as <a target="_blank" href="https://www.wikiart.org/en/edgar-degas">Edgar Degas</a> (in the solitary, pensive figure), <a target="_blank" href="https://www.wikiart.org/en/pierre-bonnard">Pierre Bonnard</a> (in the sumptuous color), <a target="_blank" href="https://www.wikiart.org/en/henri-matisse">Henri Matisse</a> (in fusing the three-dimensional figure with the essentially two-dimensional abstract background), and the German Expressionists (in the mask-like face and the freedom of the brushstroke). From their examples, he learned to paint the sole figure - newly imbued with a level of human psychology - embedded within the abstract surface design.<br><br><a target="_blank" href="https://www.theartstory.org/artist/diebenkorn-richard/artworks/#pnt_4">By Theartstory</a></span>

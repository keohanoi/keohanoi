        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">Paul Gauguin and Vincent van Gogh had an early friendship, which blossomed into an invitation to Arles, France, where van Gogh wanted Gauguin to stay with him and create an art colony. This painting was completed during Gauguin’s stay in Arles, depicting van Gogh painting his famous work Sunflowers. Unfortunately, Gaugin and Van Gogh were unable to create their art colony, as Gauguin only stayed for two months. The pair quarreled, and in December of 1888, Gauguin confronted van Gogh with a razor blade. Van Gogh, panicking, fled to a brothel, where he cut off his lower left ear lobe. Gauguin later left and the two never saw each other again. </span>

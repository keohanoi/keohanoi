        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">Nature truly fascinates Arne Quinze in plethora different manners. He is a real admirer, a true addict. His flower garden is a laboratory for studies on colours and shapes. The diversity he finds around his house — only a miniscule sampling of nature — is truly stunning. If only we could build cities as balanced as nature’s ecosystems, they would be far more human.<br><br><i>“I had the most baffling experiences during some hikes through the jungle. It is nature in its most pure but also most harsh form. Excitement and wonder at the same time. You are in the middle of it and you can’t think of something else. It sucks all of your energy. There’s so much to see, to hear, to smell,… For a moment, nothing else matters. This is highly addictive to me. And still it’s strange that the jungle has become a very harsh environment for us humans. We have outgrown nature so much that the most natural environments of the world have become our most hostile environments. But I challenge myself to bring nature back to humanity. Nature is a forgotten source of knowledge. Amazonia brings my raw take on nature back into the urban environment.”</i></span>

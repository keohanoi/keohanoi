        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">In 1985 Warhol became the first artist commissioned to create a portrait of the Absolut Vodka bottle in what would become one of the most successful advertising campaigns of the twentieth century. Following the triumph of the <i>Absolut Warhol</i> ads, the president of the company that owned Absolut, Michael Roux, encouraged Warhol to suggest other artists that could be used in the campaign. Over the years more than three hundred and fifty artists have been commissioned, including <a target="_blank" href="https://www.wikiart.org/en/keith-haring/absolut-haring-1986">Keith Haring</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.wikiart.org/en/edward-ruscha/absolut-ruscha-1988">Ed Ruscha</a> - both suggested by Warhol. In 1988, alongside the famous names, Roux began selecting less well-known artists, viewing the commission as an opportunity to launch their career. Interestingly, although Warhol never usually drank alcohol, he did use Absolut as a perfume.</span>

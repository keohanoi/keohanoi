        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">Portraits of ancient rulers were popular collectors’ items in the Middle Ages. They were often set in splendid golden works of art and frequently re-interpreted in accordance with Christian beliefs. This is certainly true of the Cross of Lothar in Aachen, an outstanding work of Ottonian gold craftsmanship created around the year 1000, which features a large cameo portrait of Caesar Augustus at its centre. The cameo portrait in the Shrine of the Magi in Cologne was also set in a prominent position, namely to the left of the image of the Last Judgement in the upper section.</span>

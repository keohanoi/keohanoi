      <p class="description">
        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">One of Corot’s poetic masterpieces, this painting is one of most successful works. As it incorporates the realistic elements of a real world image, but romanticize in such a way as to create a dreamlike image, Corot’s work can be seen as a bridge between Realism and Impressionism. In the 1860’s Corot became interested in the art of photography, and this is apparent in the way this painting is presented, as it resembles an early blurry landscape photograph. Unlike most landscape paintings, this one was not created from real life, but from Corot’s remembrance of the ways in which the light played off the water and leaves of the trees. </span>

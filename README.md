        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">De Zeven Zusters / Seven Sisters was a group of trees standing diagonally over the harbor-island KNSM-island in Amsterdam, in opposite of the building Loods 6 where Paul Werner had his studio for circa 10 years.
<br>Between the trunks of the trees one can see a glimpse of  the neighbour-island: Java-island, also a former Amsterdam harbor-area full of cranes.
<br>Many times Paul Werner pictured the environments of Loods 6 on KNSM-eiland, where he had his studio. This litho print is made after a sketch. 
<br>
<br>Owner of this lithography-print 1/2 on paper - including the copyrights - is the Amsterdam City Archives - Beeldbank Amsterdam</span>

The magnificently tactile Medusa on the front of the body may well fulfill her time-honored function of guardian and averter of evil. A statuette once stood on the ledge between her wings. Four such vases were found in the the same burial. <br><br><a target="_blank" href="https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/247408">The Met</a></span>

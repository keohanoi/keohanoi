        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">Perseus Freeing Andromeda is a painting by the Italian Renaissance painter <a target="_blank" href="/en/piero-di-cosimo">Piero di Cosimo</a>, c. executed in 1510 or 1513 It is housed in the Uffizi Gallery of Florence, Italy.
<br>
<br>The painting is mentioned in 1568 by <a target="_blank" href="/en/giorgio-vasari">Giorgio Vasari</a>, who states that it was commissioned by Filippo Strozzi the Elder, and gifted by Giovanni Battista Strozzi to a member of Cosimo I de' Medici's personnel.
<br>
<br>The work shows the mythological hero Perseus killing the monster who had entrapped Andromeda. Piero gave a great deal of attention to the background, perhaps inspired to the contemporary Flemish school: details include the two characters with a turban on the left, the very detailed painting of the water on the shore, and the fantastic musical instruments.</span>

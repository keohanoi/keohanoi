        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">Edgar Allen Poe published his poem The Raven in 1845, and although it did not bring the writer much money, it did bring him much fame. The poem became very popular, and it soon became republished, printed, illustrated, and parodied all throughout culture. Gustave Dore’s illustrations of the poems are an example of the response to the poem. Dore’s illustrations to the poem appeared in an independent publication in 1884, almost forty years after the original was published. Unfortunately, Dore was never able to see these illustrations in print, as he died before it was published. It remains one of the most famous poems ever written. </span>

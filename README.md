        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">The straw hat is an oil painting by <a target="_blank" href="/en/nikolaos-lytras">Nikolaos Lytras</a> created in 1925, and is considered as one of the most daring and impressive works of early Greek <a target="_blank" href="/en/artists-by-art-movement/modernism">Modernism</a>. It is exhibited at the National Gallery of Greece.
<br>
<br>The theme depicts a young girl with a straw hat in a whitened courtyard in an island landscape during a hot summer day.
<br>
<br>It is characteristic of the work of Lystras, who was one of the most notable figures of the Art Group founded in 1917 influenced by <a target="_blank" href="/en/artists-by-art-movement/expressionism">expressionism</a>. The artist uses strong and vivid colors, cold and blue-gray cold on the bottom, orange-yellow warm colors at the top. This painting is dominated by shades of yellow with a complementary purple that paints the figure with wide free strokes of thick paint and gestural brushwork, emphasizing the material nature of the color.</span>

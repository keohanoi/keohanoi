        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">Samson and Delilah is a 1620 painting by <a target="_blank" href="/en/anthony-van-dyck">Anthony van Dyck</a>. He produced it just after his return from Italy and shortly before leaving for London It was heavily inspired by his tutor <a target="_blank" href="/en/peter-paul-rubens">Rubens</a>'s version of the same subject and for a long time was attributed to Rubens. Van Dyck inverted the composition and showed Delilah in white chalk make-up and heavily rouged cheeks, the makeup traditionally worn by Parisian prostitutes. The painting is now held in the Dulwich Picture Gallery in London. He returned to the subject in 1630.</span>

On his head he wears a pink ribbon, as a diadem. After the end of the Karagiozis play Athanasios Diakos by Sotiris Spatharis, Evgenios, dressed as an angel, would recite a poem and crown a zinc cutout of the hero. The flame was rendered by pink fireworks and Sotiris played the role of the pasha. A costume like the one worn by Evgenios as an angel, was worn during Carnival by a character called Diamandis. He apparently recited verses relating to love.'

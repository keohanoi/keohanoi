        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">"Each drawing is created like a note in a diary. It is a language without concepts and words, which uses abstract forms and employsâ€‹ the unconscious. It brings to the surface the hidden, incomprehensible elements of the inner world, transposing them into the soft voices of lines, forms, and colors. I give up the conceptual narration, in an attempt to return to the childlike directness of the message.<br>The square makes up a sort of framework, providing me with a sense of safety. Its external frame does not mean limitation but balances the tension of the plane, and thus the apparent chaos gravitates toward the earth, brings about peace and order, and stimulates the pulsating rhythm of the interplay of forms.<br>Drawings are a dialogue between my innermost self and inner feelings, which are self- generated. The most important objective is to reach the moment when owing to the melody of this geometric world, both experiences become for me identical."<br><br>Andrzej Nowacki, May 2003</span>

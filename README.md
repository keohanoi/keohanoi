        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">The Baptism of Christ is depicted in the lower section of the shrine on the opposite side to the Adoration of the Magi. A wave representing the river Jordan swells up in front of Christ while St John the Baptist, who is dressed in a garment of camel hair, uses a bowl to pour water over Christ. On the right, an angel stands holding the Lord’s robes. There are several reasons for the inclusion of this scene. Firstly, the feast of the Baptism of Christ is celebrated on the same day as the Epiphany, namely on 6 January. Secondly, according to the Gospel according to Matthew, the baptism of Christ was God’s first public acknowledgement of Jesus as his son: ‘This is my beloved son.’</span>

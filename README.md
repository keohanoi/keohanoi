        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">This self-portrait shows Kahlo as an androgynous figure. Scholars have seen this gesture as a confrontational response to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.wikiart.org/en/diego-rivera">Rivera</a>'s demand for a divorce, revealing the artist's injured sense of female pride and her self-punishment for the failures of her marriage. Her masculine attire also reminds the viewer of early family photographs in which Kahlo chose to wear a suit. The cropped hair also presents a nuanced expression of the artist's identity. She holds one cut braid in her left hand while many strands of hair lie scattered on the floor. The act of cutting a braid symbolizes a rejection of girlhood and innocence, but equally can be seen as the severance of a connective cord (maybe umbilical) that binds two people or two ways of life. Either way, braids were a central element in Kahlo's identity as the traditional <i>La Mexicana</i>, and in the act of cutting off her braids, she rejects some aspect of her former identity.<br><br>The hair strewn about the floor echoes an earlier self-portrait painted as the Mexican folkloric figure <i>La Llorana,</i> here ridding herself of these female attributes. Kahlo clutches a pair of scissors, as the discarded strands of hair become animated around her feet; the tresses appear to have a life of their own as they curl across the floor and around the legs of her chair. Above her sorrowful scene, Kahlo inscribed the lyrics and music of a song that declares cruelly, "Look, if I loved you it was for your hair, now that you are hairless, I don't love you anymore," confirming Kahlo's own denunciation and rejection of her female roles.<br><br>In likely homage to Kahlo's painting, Finnish photographer <a target="_blank" href="https://www.wikiart.org/en/elina-brotherus">Elina Brotherus</a> photographed <a target="_blank" href="https://www.wikiart.org/en/elina-brotherus/wedding-portraits-1997"><i>Wedding Portraits</i></a> in 1997. On the occasion of her marriage, Brotherus cuts her hair, the remains of which her new husband holds in his hands. The act of cutting one's hair symbolic of a moment of change happens in the work of other female artists too, including that of <a target="_blank" href="https://www.wikiart.org/en/francesca-woodman">Francesca Woodman</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.wikiart.org/en/rebecca-horn">Rebecca Horn</a>.</span>

        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">Throughout the sixties the number of compositional elements in Brooks' artworks decreased. The frenetic movement of his earlier works also relaxed. The paintings became slower, and the palette was often reduced, as in Number 13, to just black and white, or to primary hues. By placing these kinds of limitations on his paintings, Brooks hoped to achieve what he termed a "looming mystery."</span>

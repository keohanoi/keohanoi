        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">Arne Quinze’s Red Beacon has been conceived to draw people into the Jing’an Sculpture Park in the heart of Shanghai. The park is part of the Jing’an International Sculpture Project, a governmental public art event in Shanghai. The installation is classic Arne Quinze: 55 tons of wood that make up a vibrant red canopy designed to promote social interaction. The bridge-like form serves to bridge gaps between the people who will come together beneath the sculpture and its surrounding trees.</span>

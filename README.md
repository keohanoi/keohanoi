      <p class="description">
        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">In his Constellations series of 1940-1, Mir贸 set about to create new challenges in composition and then to solve them. One from this series of ten multi-media works on paper, The Beautiful Bird Revealing the Unknown to a Pair of Lovers, features a reducedpalette, including a solid background that emphasizes the simplified forms and lines that together mimic the appearance of a complex constellation in the night sky. In the midst of producing this series, Mir贸 was forced to flee with his family from France to Mallorca to escape advancing German troops. Evidently the family took little else with them aside from these paintings. The crowded, chaotic feeling of these compositions in some ways echo Mir贸'sfeelings regarding the violent upheaval in Europe at the time.</span>

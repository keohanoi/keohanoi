        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">In a room richly decorated with autumnal colours and Chinese patterns, two women stand in line. One is blonde and more mature than her smaller red-haired colleague. Both have lifted their chemises to reveal naked buttocks and thighs and black knee-length stockings. The blonde has a look of resignation. Her eyes are downcast and her dress gathered in front to preserve what remains of her dignity. Her younger colleague seems more assertive. With her bright red hair, rouged cheeks and chemise hoisted high, she approaches her assignation with some boldness. A third women in a turquoise kimono (probably another colleague) walks away from them towards a group of people below a large window through which can be seen a clock tower (perhaps a church or the nearby Bibliotèque Nationale).</span>

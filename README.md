        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">Manfred Kielnhofer is an Austrian painter, sculptor, designer and photographer. Since 2000 he lives as a free artist in Linz. He has built a waterplate in his studio, where he takes photos of models sitting or lying on a mirror. His work relates to my theme of point of view as the waterplate allows a reflection to be seen, which the person in the photograph can be use to view and reflect on themselves and their lives.</span>

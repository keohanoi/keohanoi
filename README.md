The presence of this paradoxical capital of a free world in the perfect triangle between London, Paris, and Bruxelles, capitals of colonialism, represent a thorn in the side of Europe, a constant inquiry on the betrayed foundations of the modern European ideal. It is on the beach of Calais that Europe keeps on shipwrecking. It has no answers for the inhabitants of the Jungle. This run aground ruin, in the with the strip of land between the sea, the barb-wired motorway and the Jungle has the aspect of a shipwrecked star, one of the European flag’s.</span>

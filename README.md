        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">The fashionable costume worn by the figure in this portrait includes an ornamented white chemise under a green satin overdress; a red-striped orange fichu, or triangular scarf, covering her shoulders; and a wiglike headdress decorated with blue and gold ribbon.Although the sitter is unknown, Bartolomeo Veneto has provided a sign of what might have been her favorite sport. She wears a hawking glove on her right hand and holds her left glove in her left hand. This is an unusual detail, since European falconers traditionally carried their birds on their left hands. The subject of this painting may have been left-handed.The artist signed the work on the cartellino, or tag, attached to the dark red curtain.</span>

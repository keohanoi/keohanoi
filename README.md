        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">Arne Quinze has been working obsessively on this giant work called The 12 Months.  It is an assemblage of all his research of nature from the past years. Each canvas represents his take on that month’s specific colour palette and formal dynamic. Challenging himself to capture the true beauty and diversity of our precious nature.  <br><br>Overall: 3 meters tall, 26 meters long. Acrylic on canvas."‘The Twelve Months’ is a study of light and the changes nature undergoes in the course of the year. It was precisely because I spent so much time in my garden that I was confronted with this and I wanted to capture the feeling."</span>

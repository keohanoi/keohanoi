        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">This portrait of an unidentified woman was one of the first <a target="_blank" href="https://www.wikiart.org/en/paintings-by-style/neo-impressionism">Neo-Impressionist</a> portraits. As many of the group concentrated on depicting color in its greatest luminosity, their subject matter tended toward <a target="_blank" href="https://www.wikiart.org/en/paintings-by-genre/landscape">landscapes</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.wikiart.org/en/paintings-by-genre/cityscape">cityscapes</a>, but a few artists went beyond such subjects. The MAMC in Saint-Étienne, France has dubbed her <i>Madame P</i>, but, at the time of the work's inception, art critic Félix Fénéon called her <i>Mademoiselle B</i>. Seated in an upholstered chair, placed before a background wallpapered with floral arabesques, the woman dressed in white, a blue flower on her breast, looks with an indifferent gaze past the viewer.<br><br>Albert Dubois-Pillet was a career military officer and self-trained artist whose artistic endeavors were often discouraged by the military establishment. He met <a target="_blank" href="https://www.wikiart.org/en/paul-signac">Paul Signac</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.wikiart.org/en/georges-seurat">Georges Seurat</a> in 1884 and joined them in founding the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-painting-school/soci-t-des-artistes-ind-pendants-society-of-independent-artists#!#resultType:masonry">Société des Artistes Indépendants</a>. He began experimenting with Neo-Impressionism and by 1885 had adopted the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.wikiart.org/en/paintings-by-style/pointillism">Pointillist</a> technique, becoming one of the first artists to do so. The shimmering effect of the subtle gold arabesques in the wallpaper, the blue flower, and the touches of color in her white dress convey a sense of wealth and elegance, yet the woman seems static as if her figure was meant to be the decorative element of the room.</span>

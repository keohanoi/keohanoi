        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">Josef Albers described his most famous series, Homage to the Square, as "platters to serve color." He began the series in 1949 and worked on it until his death in 1976. This earlier version depicts his systematic approach in investigating optical effects of colors when placed in a static square shape. With this series, Albers explored how colors change depending on their placement within the composition. </span>

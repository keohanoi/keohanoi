        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">Hokusai created literally thousands of these manga drawings, which were dedicated to realism and an accurate portrayal of life. The Hokusai Manga was initially created to attract art pupils and create money, but they are also regarded as works of art in their own right. They include images of animals, religious figures, people, and the supernatural, and many of the drawings are humorous in nature. Hokusai created over twelve books of manga drawings, which were very popular at the time, and immediately became a success. After his death, three more books of Hokusai Manga drawings were published. </span>

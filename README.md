        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">The apparently random collection of papers in Aphorism come together to create a tiny but carefully balanced composition. The subtle tones of the pieces of buff paper are accented by insertions of strong colour. The layers are piled high in the top left corner, while in the lower corner the blue, green and white patterned paper seems to form a human profile. The alignment of the profile's mouth with the dotted line across the centre of the collage is perhaps suggestive of Schwitters' poetic recitations.</span>

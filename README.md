        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">The Annunciation is a painting by the Italian Renaissance painter <a target="_blank" href="/en/filippo-lippi">Filippo Lippi</a>, finished around 1445-1450. It is housed in the Galleria Doria Pamphilj, Rome.
<br>
<br>Differences with other depictions of the Annunciation include the angel's position on the right and the use of a very bright source of light, inspired by works of <a target="_blank" href="/en/filippo-brunelleschi">Filippo Brunelleschi</a> and <a target="_blank" href="/en/fra-angelico">Beato Angelico</a>. On the top are the hands of God, emerging from the clouds and releasing the dove of the Holy Ghost. The dove descends along a luminous trail running toward the Virgin's shoulder, transmitting the Divine Will through materialized light.

<br>The architectural framework may be the work of an assistant.</span>

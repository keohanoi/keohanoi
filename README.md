        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">Presented at the inaugural Milan Triennale in 1891, <i>Le due madri</i> is one of Segantini's most celebrated and talked-about works, and affirmed the revolutionary new technique known as <a target="_blank" href="https://www.wikiart.org/en/paintings-by-style/divisionism">Divisionism</a>. This genre scene, traditional only in appearance, represents the first step in Segantini's progression towards a so-called "painting of ideas." The woman with the baby, and the cow with her calf, are elevated into universal symbols of motherhood.<br><br>The studied effect of artificial light, shown in the rendering of the lantern-lit stable, gives this humble scene an intensity that could only be achieved via the Divisionist technique. Inspired by a profound and sincere sense of observation, this scene is captured through filamented brushstrokes of divided colors, with pure colors applied directly to the canvas. The final effect is a work whose meaning goes beyond reality and aspires to represent a universal image of the origins of life.</span>

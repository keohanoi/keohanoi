        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">This artwork is a part of The Legend of the True Cross - a series of frescoes painted by Francesca in the Basilica of San Francesco in Arezzo. Not only is it his largest work, but it is also considered one of his finest, as well as one of the finest works of the Early Renaissance period. The theme of the frescoes was derived from a 13th century book on the lives of the Saints, and the Triumph of the True Cross, which was said to be the actual cross on which Christ was crucified. The exact date of the painting is unknown, but it believed to be after 1447, when the Bacci family of Arezzo paid an unidentified painter. </span>

        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">Long conjectured to portray Alban Berg, who did not visit Gmunden in 1908, this nonetheless has clear affinities with those that Gerstl painted there, notably in its broad brushstrokes, subject representation and background. Since this displays a thinner application than the heavy paint deposits seen in his later portraits from his 1908 vacation, it can probably be counted amongst his earlier works of the summer and therefore painted in Vienna before Gerstl set off for Gmunden at the end of June.</span>

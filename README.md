        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">The Woman with Gambling Mania is an 1822 painting by <a target="_blank" href="/en/theodore-gericault">Théodore Géricault</a>. It is a member of a series of ten portraits of people with specific manias done by Géricault between 1820 and 1824, including Portrait of a Kleptomaniac and Insane Woman. Following the controversy surrounding his The Raft of the Medusa, Géricault fell into a depression. In return for help by psychiatrist Étienne-Jean Georget, Géricault offered him a series of paintings of mental patients, including this one, in a time when the scientific world was curious about the minds of the mentally insane. A solid example of <a target="_blank" href="/en/artists-by-art-movement/romanticism">romanticism</a>, Géricault's portrait of a mental asylum patient attempts to show a specific form of insanity through facial expression.

<br>This painting was acquired by the Louvre in 1938.

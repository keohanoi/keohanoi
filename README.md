        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">The Ray of Light, also known as Le Coup de Soleil, (c. 1665) is an <a target="_blank" href="/en/paintings-by-media/oil-on-sacking">oil</a> on canvas painting by the Dutch painter Jacob van Ruisdael. It is an example of Dutch Golden Age painting and is now in the collection of the Louvre Museum.
<br>
<br>This painting was documented by Hofstede de Groot in 1911, who wrote; "664. THE BURST OF SUNSHINE (" Le Coup de Soleil ").
<br>
<br>Sm. 11. A road leads diagonally across the picture from the left foreground to the right distance. On the left a horseman in a red cloak rides forward&nbsp;; a beggar asks him for alms. A dog runs in front. In the centre the road crosses a stone bridge of four arches over a river to a ruined square tower with an archway. The broad river flows to the right, where three persons bathe near rocks in mid stream. On the farther bank are hills, with a ruined castle half-way up the slope. To the right is a wind-mill; farther back is a village with a church tower. A ray of sunlight, breaking through thick clouds, falls on a field in the left middle distance. The figures, though ascribed in the catalogue to Ph. Wouwerman, are by Ruisdael himself. The picture is strongly influenced by <a target="_blank" href="/en/rembrandt">Rembrandt</a>'s landscapes, especially in composition. [Cf. 788.] Signed with the monogram on the left&nbsp;; canvas, 33 inches by 39 inches.
<br>
<br>Engraved by Laurent in the Musée Français. In the collection of King Louis XVI.
<br>
<br>In the Louvre, Paris, 1902 catalogue, No. 2560; it was valued by the experts in 1816 (at 15,000 francs)".

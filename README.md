        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">The Recanati Annunciation (Italian: Annunciazione di Recanati) is a painting by the Italian Renaissance painter <a target="_blank" href="/en/lorenzo-lotto">Lorenzo Lotto</a>, executed around 1534 and housed in the Civic Museum of Villa Colloredo Mels, Recanati, Italy.
<br>
<br>The work could date to the artist's sojourn in Venice, from where it would be shipped to the Marche around 1527. Otherwise, it could date to a later period when he moved there to executed other works. Today it is generally assigned to a few time after the Crucifixion of Monte San Giusto (1533-1534).
<br>
<br>The commissioners were perhaps the Brotherhood of the Recanati Traders, who moved to a new seat in 1533 and would therefore use the work for the latter's decoration.
<br>
<br>The canvas is mentioned for the first time in 1601.
<br>
<br>The painting depicts a bedroom where an Annunciation takes place following an unusual scheme: the angel is on the right, holding a white lily, and has got in from a loggia which opens to a garden (the hortus conclusus). His right arm is pointing at the Father God who has shown in a cloud and is blessing Mary from inside the loggia. Mary is portrayed in the left foreground, looking at the spectator and raising her hands in a surprised gesture.
<br>
<br>Stylistically, Lotto used expressive gestures and somewhat under-size heads. The number of carefully painted details show the influence of Northern European paintings: they include the baldachin bed, the small window with sealed glasses, the shelf with a small still life, the hatstand, the stool with an hourglass, the prie-dieu and a scared cat which is fleeing. The baldachin was inspired by a relief by Andrea Sansovino at Loreto.
<br>
<br>The Madonna who face the seer and the angel who tries to draw her attention are taken instead from <a target="_blank" href="/en/titian">Titian</a> works. According to Italian art historian Giulio Carlo Argan:</span>

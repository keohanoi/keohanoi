        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">In this portion of the fresco cycle from the Arena Chapel, you can almost feel the energy in the air. Jesus and Judas stand in the middle of he painting, surrounded by followers and enemies of Jesus. The commotion seems to be just beginning, and as Judas reaches up to give Jesus a kiss, the figures almost look as if they will jump out of the art and begin fighting. This fresco is a great example of the way in which Giotto draped his figures is realistically full heavy cloth, and created real human emotions on the faces of his figures. Each person seems to be asking a different question: Will Judas kiss Jesus? What will happen next? </span>

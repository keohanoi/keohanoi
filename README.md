        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">Portrait of a Young Venetian Woman is a small bust-length oil on elm panel painting by the German artist <a target="_blank" href="/en/albrecht-durer">Albrecht Dürer</a> from 1505. It was executed, along with a number of other high-society portraits, during his second visit to Italy.
<br>
<br>The woman wears a patterned gown with tied-on sleeves that show the chemise beneath. Her hair frames her face in soft waves, and back hair is confined in a small draped cap. The work's harmony and grace is achieved through its mixtures of tones, from her pale, elegant skin and reddish blond hair to her black-and pearl necklace and highly-fashionable patterned dress; all of which are highlighted against a flat black background. It is similar in pose and colour tone to his c 1507 A German Woman from Venice, while at least two studies of Venetian women are known, both of which are very daring. One shows the model with a plunging neckline, the other with bare shoulders.
<br>
<br>During his visit to Italy Dürer became fascinated by and befriended <a target="_blank" href="/en/giovanni-bellini">Giovanni Bellini</a>, an established master when Dürer was still a relative unknown outside of Germany. The Franconian artist's influence can be seen in this work's soft modeling, dramatic lighting and vivid colours and tones.
<br>
<br>The work was not identified as a Dürer original until it was found in a private Lithuanian collection in 1923. The identity of the sitter is lost; however, in dress and hairstyle, she appears to be Venetian, rather than Germanic. The portrait is unfinished; a number of elements, noticeably the black bow above her chest, are not as well described as other passages.</span>

        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">The three-dimensional forms of this work project colour into the room, reflecting Pasmore’s long-running concern with the expansion of the forms of a picture into real space. To this end, the transparency of the perspex serves to create an ambiguity between the structure of the work of art and its surroundings. Holes in the top corners of the perspex plane and photographs reveal that this relief was originally intended to be suspended from the ceiling.</span>

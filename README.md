        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">Poussin created two similar paintings, both of which revolve around figures in the countryside inspecting a tomb. Each has the same title, Et in Arcadia Ego, engraved on the tomb, which in Latin roughly translates as “I exist even in Arcadia,” as if it is spoken by the dead. Other interpretations of the saying state that the inscription on the tomb simply reads “I was an Arcadian.” Either way, this painting, in a more Baroque style reminiscent of his earlier works, remains one of Poussin’s most influential paintings. It has also inspired a documentary about the painting entitled In Arcadia, surrounding the Poussin painting. </span>

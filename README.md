        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">Salisbury Cathedral from the Meadows is considered one of Constable's most emotionally charged works and is often viewed as a reflection of the artist's personal turmoil. The painting depicts the cathedral standing resolutely against a turbulent sky, with a rainbow arching over it. The composition is filled with symbolism, and its meaning has been the subject of much interpretation.<br><br>In addition to the rainbow, the painting also includes a number of other symbolic elements. For example, the cathedral itself is a symbol of hope and resilience in the face of adversity. The storm clouds that surround it can be seen as a metaphor for the struggles and challenges that Constable himself was facing in his personal life. The dark, brooding sky may also represent the mood of the nation at the time, which was undergoing significant social and political changes.<br><br>Despite the turbulence of the sky, the painting also contains moments of serenity and beauty. The river that runs through the foreground is depicted in tranquil shades of blue and green, while the trees and foliage are rendered in lush, vibrant colors. This contrast between chaos and calm gives the painting a sense of depth and complexity, and reinforces the idea that beauty can be found even in the darkest of times.<br><br>Salisbury Cathedral from the Meadows is widely regarded as one of Constable's greatest works, and has been the subject of numerous critical studies and interpretations. Its emotional power and complex symbolism continue to captivate viewers and scholars alike, and it remains an enduring testament to the genius of John Constable.</span>

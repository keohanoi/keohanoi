      <p class="description">
        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">Lucifero (Lucifer) is a research about the archetype of the devil. It is research about the role of evil in God’s plans, about the concept of “mistake” and about redemption. This third chapter of the project “Seven Seasons of the Spirit” works on a theological perspective, using the archetypes of Christianity as a widely shared symbolic plane that can create, with the visitors, a deep dialogue that may, in the end, turn into a political perspective. This monumental work of 65.000 sq/f is focused on a solitary figure, the visitor itself, who finds himself in a constant game of reflections. Feeling confused, feeling like the devil can allow the visitor to feel the deep and infinite nostalgia of the light that dominates the character who gives the name to this installation.<br><br>(ex Magazzini Generali del porto, Napoli)</span>

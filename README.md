        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">This work was made at the Andrew Freedman Home in the Bronx, a hospice for rich people who became poor, build in 1922. The building was closed for almost 30 years. Every day the sunlight got into the empty rooms. Day by day the light attacked the same defenseless surfaces changing them. The work starts with this consideration to read metamorphosis. Light crystallized everything. Only cold-blood elements, like metal and glass, were used in the work. A mosaic made of all the broken glasses, found by the artist inside the building after all those years of abandon, covers the floor.<br><br>(Andrew Freedman Home, New York City)</span>

<br>
<br>The centre panel depicts the Risen Jesus triumphantly emerging from the tomb, surrounded by frightened Roman soldiers. The left-hand panel depicts John the Baptist, while the right-hand panel shows Martina of Rome. These saints are, respectively, the patrons and namesakes of printer Jan Moretus of the Plantin Press, and his widow Martina Plantin, who placed the commission for the triptych.</span>

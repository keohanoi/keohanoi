        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">K-1952, one of Brooks’ masterworks from the height of his career, illustrates the basic ideas behind the abstract expressionist movement, which took large scale, vibrant color, bold gesture, and challenging abstract form as central ingredients and changed the course of 20th-century art. In particular, Brooks used staining, dripping, overprinting, and direct application of paint to create an “all over” composition in which there is no one central focus for the eye. In a rich, alternately bold and subtle palette of greens, reds, and oranges, Brooks created in this work a dazzling atmosphere of vibrancy and movement that possesses within its frame an undeniable energy and an abstract language unmistakably its own.</span>

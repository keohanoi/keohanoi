        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">This print comments on the resonance of commercial names and hence advertising's ability to exalt mechanics or technology into a legendary sphere. Engraved illustrations of breeds of cattle are captioned with car names.<br><br>Various breeds of cattle are presented in a grid-like pattern resembling pages from an educational or scientific manual. However, the names printed beneath each cow are those of car manufacturers. As a young man, Broodthaers befriended the Surrealist painter <a target="_blank" href="https://www.wikiart.org/en/rene-magritte">René Magritte</a>. One of Magritte's most famous paintings (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.wikiart.org/en/rene-magritte/the-treachery-of-images-this-is-not-a-pipe-1948"><i>The treachery of images</i></a>, 1929) featured a picture of a pipe with the words 'This is not a pipe' written in French underneath. Broodthaers was fascinated by the way Magritte used words to contradict a visual image. Here he plays his own game, pitting visual and linguistic meanings against each another.</span>

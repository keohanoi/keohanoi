        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">One of El Greco’s earlier works, The Dormition of the Virgin was not attributed to him until 1983, when his signature was discovered at the bottom of the painting. This discovery led to the attribution of more of his earlier works, including Modena Triptych and Adoration of the Magi. The discovery of this piece as an El Greco painting has led to insights on his artistic style and subject matter. Painted in the Byzantine manner, this painting suggests that the artist changed his painting style in order to fit the subject matter and other requirements of the painting, including the desired location. </span>

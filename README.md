        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">This water-lily table lamp is one of Tiffany's most successfully executed designs for his firm's well-known leaded-glass products. The overall organic character of the lamp is emphasized throughout the piece in its details. The bronze support replicates broad, flat lily pads clustered around a base, out of which rise attenuated climbing stems that disappear into the shade and reemerge in glass at the crown, drawing the eye to the cascading blossoms of the irregular border. A variety of glass was used to great advantage, as seen in the alternation of the pink opalescent stems with those of translucent rippled blue, giving the appearance of a bog where water lilies might be found.</span>

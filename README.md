At the same time, however, we see Luini subscribing to the style of Leonardo da Vinci, not only in the Virgin’s facial features but also in the pose of the Christ Child, whom several scholars have likened to Leonardo’s study of a Madonna and Child with a Cat. Jesus is clutching a columbine whose colour alludes both to the blood of Christ and to the grief of his mother.</span>

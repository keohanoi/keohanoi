        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">Boy Carrying a Sword is an 1861 <a target="_blank" href="/en/paintings-by-media/oil-on-sacking">oil painting</a> by the French artist <a target="_blank" href="/en/edouard-manet">Édouard Manet</a> and is now displayed at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. The work depicts a small boy costumed as a page of the Spanish court of the seventeenth century; he is holding a full-sized sword and sword belt. The work was later reproduced as an engraving under the direction of Dijon painter and etcher Alphonse Legros who collaborated in the work.
<br>
<br>According to Émile Zola, the work is typical of the influence of Spanish painters and shows the strong influence <a target="_blank" href="/en/diego-velazquez">Diego Velázquez</a> and <a target="_blank" href="/en/frans-hals">Frans Hals</a> had on Manet at the time.
<br>
<br>The artist's model was Leon Leenhoff, the stepson of the artist after his marriage to Suzanne in 1862.</span>

        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">It's not just the scale of "The Rose" that has captivated eyes and minds for decades; the petrified flower radiates a quiet light from its center, emanating mystery and inner power. Kenneth Baker wrote in his San Francisco Chronicle review, "From a distance, the central starburst form that DeFeo grooved deeply into its surface appears to radiate a light that levitates the work's prodigious mass." Applying layer after layer of paint until the work weighed over 2,000 lbs., DeFeo transformed her painting into sculpture like a spiritual conversion. (Priscilla Frank)</span>

        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">Almost all of what we have left of Jacopo Bellini’s art is contained in two sketch books, which hold at least three hundred small drawings. Many of these drawings are much more varied in theme than his remaining paintings, including this one, of the nativity. The drawings are also much more complete works than mere sketches, some of them containing more detail than his fully complete painted works. This particular work was completed in 1445, when Bellini was around 45 years old, making it part of his mature period. </span>

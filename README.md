        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">Vigée Le Brun's Self Portrait in a Straw Hat is a tribute to the Flemish painter Peter Paul Rubens and a confident self-portrait. The artist portrays herself in a garlanded and feathered straw hat, adorned with lush fabrics of white, pink, and black, reminiscent of Rubens' earlier portrait of Susanna Lunden, known as The Straw Hat (1622-1625). In contrast to the coy sensuality of Rubens' painting, Vigée Le Brun depicts herself as a self-assured artist, holding her palette and brushes in one hand and gesturing with the other in a friendly manner. Her mouth is upturned, and her gaze meets the viewer's, indicating her amusement or readiness to speak. The background features a clouded sky, creating a contrast with the vibrancy of the subject.<br><br>Vigée Le Brun's popularity was fueled by her self-image, which she masterfully presents in this painting. Her youthful blush, almond eyes, and partially exposed white breast accentuate her beauty, emphasizing her selling power. The sumptuous clothing not only suggests wealth and luxury but also the artist's skill in painting textures and details, which is evident in the shine of the colors on her palette. The painting projects the idea that a portrait by Vigée Le Brun will be a flattering, meticulous, and pleasant experience, blurring the line between fine art and advertising. The acknowledgment of Rubens' influence in the painting also establishes Vigée Le Brun as a painter aware of the tradition of the Old Masters and worthy of their legacy.</span>

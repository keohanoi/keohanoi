        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">This view from the window of his tiny Paris flat/studio demonstrates mastery of perspective and of clarity by the École de Paris painter Jacob Macznik.  He manages to capture the enhanced clarity that exists visually when the outdoors are well-illuminated yet overcast.  Perspective is displayed by buildings, sidewalk, curb, and rooftops outside, as well as the tablecloth inside.  The bouquet adds curves, interest, and additional color to what might otherwise have been simply a technically masterful work.  It also informs us that the foreground is a table, since the vase sits atop it.  All in all, the entire image is composed with much thought, attention to detail, and artistic skill.<br><br>This painting is privately held by the artist's nephew. Denotation of the copyright is embedded within this low resolution image of the painting.</span>

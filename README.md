        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">Saint Ambrose barring Theodosius from Milan Cathedral is a 1619–1620 painting by <a target="_blank" href="/en/anthony-van-dyck">Anthony van Dyck</a>, now in the National Gallery in London.
<br>
<br>It draws heavily on a 1618 version of the same subject by Rubens which van Dyck had worked on as a studio assistant. In van Dyck's version, Theodosius is beardless, the architectural background is more defined and a spear and a halberd are added on the left-hand side.
<br>
<br>It shows the Roman emperor Theodosius I and his entourage being barred from Milan Cathedral by its archbishop Saint Ambrose, as punishment for the Massacre of Thessalonica.</span>

She was buried in a plundered tomb, which had originally been the resting place of Minmose, an official of Hatshepsut. The burial was a modest one, including a set of coffins and personal jewelry. Henettawy's body was not embalmed but simply wrapped in layers of linen bandages.<br><br>Aside from her rather simple personal jewelry, Henettawy's main burial equipment consisted of two splendid coffins and a mummy board, fitting one into the other like parts of a Russian doll. Both coffins and the mummy board are shaped like wrapped mummies with elaborate masks fastened over the heads.<br><br><a target="_blank" href="https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/590951">The Met</a></span>

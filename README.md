        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">Based on his own life and how having no sense of self disturbs the whole perception of the world around us the artist creates a open series of oil paintings entitled 'Nothing Is What It Seems' of which this is one.
<br>
<br>By challenging us to explore different interpretations to this series the artist gives us an insight into his own frame of mind including unfulfilled love affairs, disappointments and despair.

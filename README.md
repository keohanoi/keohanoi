        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">This is the most famous print created by Katsushika Hokusai, and it continues to grow in popularity and recognition worldwide. The image is of two boats, full of Japanese sailors, coming up against the namesake of the print, the Great Wave. The wave looks as if it will swallow the boats whole, and that the boat men are sure to be devoured in the wave. Although it is such a strong image, it is simplistically beautiful, with curling blue waves and white frothy tips, which menacingly curl down into points, like claws ready to scoop the sailors out of the sea. </span>

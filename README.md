        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe"> In the early 1950s Riopelle had experimented with dripping and splashing paint, creating densely covered canvases in vivid colours. He went on to develop a distinctive technique using a palette knife to apply the paint in quick, sharp strokes all over the canvas. This resulted in a thickly worked surface, or 'impasto'. This painting was executed in this way. The marks are suggestive of the painter's action in applying the paint.</span>

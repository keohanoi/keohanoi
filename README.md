        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">In this artwork, Reynolds has portrayed John the Baptist as a young child in the wilderness, showcasing three important aspects of his art. Firstly, it exemplifies his ability to create religious paintings, even though it was not his primary focus. John's wild gesturing signifies the arrival of Christ, represented by the lamb beside him and the cross he holds, symbolizing his sacrificial death. Secondly, it highlights Reynolds' inspiration from Italian Old Masters, evident in the intricate shading techniques reminiscent of Caravaggio and reference to Raphael's work. Finally, depicting John as a child provided Reynolds with the opportunity to create a fancy picture, a genre he enjoyed and was known for. According to curator Lucy Davis, "the subject allowed him to pay tribute to Old Master religious art in composition and technique while also aligning closely with his secular fancy pictures of children."</span>

        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">Jacob’s Dream (Spanish: El sueño de Jacob) is a 1639 oil-on-canvas painting by the Spanish Tenebrist painter <a target="_blank" href="/en/jusepe-de-ribera">José de Ribera</a> (Lo Spagnoletto).
<br>
<br>It measures 179 by 233 centimetres (70&nbsp;in ×&nbsp;92&nbsp;in) and is in the Museo del Prado in Madrid.
<br>
<br>Jacob appears as a shepherd sleeping, resting on his left shoulder with a tree behind him. In the background on the other side is the ladder that he sees in his dream. It is not a wooden ladder but a ladder of light, by which angels are ascending and descending.</span>

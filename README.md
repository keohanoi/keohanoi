        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">This painting is a self portrait that belongs to a private collector. Confused about his own definition of happiness the artist masks his face and wears a fruit hat. After this painting was completed the artist quoted: "Happiness comes as a consequence of continuous efforts to develop your soul and refine your mind."

<br>Recently this artwork illustrated a talk by  Fr. Thomas Joseph White, O.P. called  “A Guide to Happiness: The Promise of Thomism in the Modern Church” which took place at  the Catholic Information Center in Washington, DC.

        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">In Red Sun, Dove created a visual contrast that shows nature's balance in cycles of light and darkness. Dove attempted to penetrate outward appearances to reveal the secretive interiority of nature. Like other works during this period, undulating lines and shapes of earth and sky symbolize forces of nature, a theme that became most apparent in Dove's work during the 1930s. </span>

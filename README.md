        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">This painting is thought to be inspired by a painting of the same theme by Annibale Carracci, an Italian Baroque painter. This painting was bought at auction in 1986 for the price of 1.6 million francs. After its exhibition at the gallery, however, it was recognized as a genuine painting by Poussin, and was given back to the original seller, who raised the asking price to over 15 million euros. The Louvre and Museum of Fine Arts in Lyon were finally able to raise enough money and purchase the painting in 2007, with the final price of 17 million euros. It now resides in the Museum of Fine Arts in Lyon. </span>

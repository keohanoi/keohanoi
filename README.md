      <p class="description">
        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">Pirosmani did not have much of a family life. At the age of six, his older brother died, followed by both of his parents two years later. His two other sisters went to live with other relatives, leaving the young boy alone. He was taken in by his father’s employer and his wife, who had six children. Although Pirosmani lived with the family for over 15 years, he was little more than a family pet, taking care of the younger children, and given very little guidance. Pirosmani’s childlike naiveté in painting may have had more to due with the lack of care he received while growing up more so than his lack of a formal education in painting.</span>

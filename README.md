        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">Seven Aquatints reveals Mangold's continued fascination with the relationships between interior and exterior forms. He creates a palpable tension between the perfect outer circle and the flawed interior square. Allusions to Renaissance art abound in the rich antique tones and in the suggestion of The Proportions of Man, Leonardo da Vinci's renowned drawing of an outstretched figure within a circle and square.

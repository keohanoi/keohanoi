        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">Artemisia Receiving Mausolus' Ashes (also known as Sophonisba Receiving the Poisoned Cup) is a painting by the Dutch master <a target="_blank" href="/en/rembrandt">Rembrandt</a>. It is housed in the Museo del Prado of Madrid, Spain. It is signed "REMBRANDT F: 1634".
<br>
<br>The subject of the picture is still unclear. It portrays a young woman, variously identified as Sophonisba or Artemisia, or a generic queen due to her jewels and rich garments, receiving a cup from a maiden. The cup would contain the ashes of Artemisia's husband, King Mausolus, or, in the case of Sophonisba, the poison which killed her.
<br>
<br>For the woman, Rembrandt probably used his wife Saskia as model.</span>

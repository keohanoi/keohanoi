        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">The work is focused on all those people who have spent their lives in prison because of their ideas. on people who were strong enough to change the history from their jail with the power of their dreams of freedom and justice. I mean people like Antonio Gramsci, Nelson Mandela, or even Rubin "Hurricane" Carter.<br><br>This permanent installation is a wheat field in the deepest, darkest, and most fortified heart of Sant’Elmo Castle, the old fortress of Naples that has been used for centuries as a prison. The field needs to be regenerated constantly by Italian citizens as a ritual to demonstrate that it is possible to keep the field alive as the analogy of the heritage left to us by the men to whom the work is dedicated.</span>

        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">Louis Comfort Tiffany, the son of the founder of Tiffany &amp; Co., was one of America's preeminent artists, and he mastered many decorative media during his long and successful career. His most innovative work, however, was in glass. This autumnal landscape at sunset, a masterpiece among Tiffany's depictions of the natural world in leaded glass, draws upon all of the abilities and techniques developed in his New York workrooms. The variegated surface was achieved by wrinkling the pot-metal glass; unusual light effects were created by the mottled and confetti glass; and the sense of depth and perspective was suggested by plating more than one layer of glass.</span>

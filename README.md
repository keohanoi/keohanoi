      <p class="description">
        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">Upon his enrollment at the Academie Julian, Pierre Bonnard joined with four of his fellow artist friends to form the Les Nabis group of artists. The avant-garde group, influenced by the Impressionist, was impressed by Paul Gauguin’s use of color and decorative patterns to express feelings and elicit an emotional response from the viewer. This lithograph is an example of Bonnard’s use of blocks of color and decorative patterns in the Les Nabis style. The woman in the lithograph is the artist’s sister Andree Terasse, holding her son Jean. In the bottom right hand corner is the artist himself. </span>

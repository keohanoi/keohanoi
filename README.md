<br>This painting was documented by Hofstede de Groot in 1910, who wrote "51. A FISHER-BOY. B. 68&nbsp;; M. 255. Half-length&nbsp;; almost in full face, with the head slightly bent to the left. He laughs at the spectator&nbsp;; his mouth is open, showing the teeth. He wears a dark coat with broad sleeves, and a small red cap. He lays his right wrist on a large basket. He holds up a fish in his left hand. Very characteristic. Signed with the monogram&nbsp;; canvas, 28 1/2 inches by 23 inches. Engraved by Paul le Rat. Sale. John W. Wilson of Brussels, Paris, March 14, 1881, 1873 catalogue, p. 85. In the National Gallery of Ireland, Dublin, 1898 catalogue, No. 193."

<br>Hofstede de Groot noted several fisherboys by Hals along with this one (catalogue numbers 49 through to 58c). This painting was also documented by W.R. Valentiner in 1923.

        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">Pirosmani went missing in the summer of 1900 for few months, and when he returned, his partner in their dairy business was waiting for him with a large stipend. After this, Pirosmani began a life of drunken vagrancy, often spending days lounging around the train station at Tiflis. The train station, with hordes of people constantly coming and going, provided Pirosmani with the opportunity to observe people from all walks of life, and many of his paintings were completed during this period in his life. In this particular painting, you can almost image the Musha holding the wineskin to pass by the drunken artists, who, inspired by the image, went back to his studio to paint him. </span>

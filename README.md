<br>This painting by Hooch was documented by Hofstede de Groot in 1910, who wrote; "192. TWO LADIES AND TWO GENTLEMEN IN AN INTERIOR. Sm. 34. The party are assembled in the left-hand corner of a room, beside a large window, the upper part of which is fastened back. At the left corner of the table stands a girl, pouring out wine&nbsp;; she wears a red jacket trimmed with white fur, a blue skirt, and a large white apron. A young gentleman, wearing a white costume, with a broad collar and a slouch hat, stands behind the table looking at the girl&nbsp;; he leans with his right hand on a chair-back, and holds a pipe in his left. To the right of the table sits a gentleman in a black cape with long curls which conceal his profile&nbsp;; he takes the arm of a girl, who sits beside him and regards him with a watchful and mischievous look. In the right foreground lies his slouch hat. In the background to the right is a bed with curtains&nbsp;; above it hangs a portrait of a man, on the left of which is a map of a Dutch harbour with an inscription. The light falls from the left. It is a good picture, powerful and luminous in the rendering of light and colour. Burger regarded it as a Vermeer&nbsp;; see Gazette des Beaux Arts for 1866, p. 551, No. 14. Panel, 27 inches by 22 1/2 inches.

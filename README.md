The painting shows a key point in Gibraltar's history when the Great Siege of Gibraltar was undertaken by the Spanish against the British at Gibraltar in November 1781. The Spanish officer Don Jose de Barboza is being given respect as he lies dying. Although left behind by his own retreating troops he still unsuccessfully attacked the British troops with chivalry.
<br>
<br>The painting is based on a real attack that took place in Gibraltar on November 27, 1781. The Great Siege of Gibraltar was an unsuccessful attempt by Spain and France to capture Gibraltar from the British during the War of American Independence.
<br>
<br>The painting depicts the events of the night of November 26, 1781 when British troops made a sudden attack (sortie), against the enemy batteries. The death of the Spanish officer Don Jose de Barboza is the focal point of the painting. He fell mortally wounded and died near his post refusing assistance after having been abandoned by his troops. He is portrayed as rejecting the aid of General George Elliott, commander of the British troops.
<br>
<br>In 1782, the Siege was lifted and Trumbull's friend Antonio de Poggi, an artist and dealer based in London who had been in the besieged garrison, told him of an earlier incident, which had occurred in November 1781. This had all the ingredients he sought: “...the Heroism of the vanquished, the Humanity of the Victors - the darkness of night illuminating an extensive conflagration - the Hurry and Tumult of the troops busy in the work of destruction - the quiet &amp; calm of the Officers, the guiding Spirits of the Scene.”
<br>
<br>Trumbull labored on the composition, over many sketches and three large completed canvases. As the project progressed, Trumbull's ambitions for it to be his big breakthrough to major patronage grew too. He refused large offers for the picture, preferring to exhibit it privately for admission fees.
<br>
<br>Horace Walpole, 4th Earl of Orford had called the painting: “the finest picture <i>had ever seen painted on the northern side of the Alps.”
<br>
<br>The painting is depicted on the back of the 2010 Gibraltar 10-pound note.</i></span>

        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">Madonna was another painting of which Munch made many reproductions. Although it is a very unique representation, this painting depicts Mary, Mother of Jesus. Unlike the typical depiction of Mary as a fully clothed, chaste woman, this piece portrays her as a fully developed, sexually mature woman. This painting was stolen along with The Scream in 2004. Although the thieves were immediately caught, it was thought that they destroyed the two paintings, which were evidence of their crime. The Norwegian government offered a 2 million kroner reward, but the paintings were not returned. Finally, in 2006, the Norwegian government obtained the paintings in an undisclosed operation, retuning the two painting to the museum under tight security.</span>

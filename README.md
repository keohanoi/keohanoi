        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">Van Gogh created a series of sunflower paintings in 1888. He created them as decorations for the Yellow House in Arles in which Van Gogh’s houseguest, Paul Gaugin would be staying, Unfortunately, due to a falling-out with Gaugin, after which Van Gogh sliced off his own earlobe in a paranoid panic, Van Gogh was never able to decorate his yellow house. He instead sent the paintings to exhibition, imagining the two sunflower paintings one either side of his Berceuse painting, and calling it the Berceuse Triptych, exhibiting the paintings at the Les XX exhibit in Paris. He later displayed all three paintings together at the aforementioned exhibit in 1890. </span>

        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">After the first world war Wadsworth made a number of drawings of industrial landscapes. They represent a key phase in his development. Like his earlier Vorticist work they are concerned with regular forms reduced to simple planes. But they also show him attempting to forge a more realistic and unidealised vision of the modern world in the aftermath of war. Appropriately, they focus on the waste products of industrialisation, in particular quarries and slag heaps.</span>

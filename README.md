        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">The Portrait of Lucina Brembati is a painting by the Italian <a target="_blank" href="/en/artists-by-art-movement/high-renaissance">High Renaissance</a> painter <a target="_blank" href="/en/lorenzo-lotto">Lorenzo Lotto</a>, dating to c. 1521/23. It is housed in the Accademia Carrara of Bergamo, northern Italy.
<br>
<br>The work is known since 1882, when the Accademia acquired it from a private collection. The subject was identified later, after the rebus included in it was recognized: the moon in the upper left background contains the inscription "CI", which, in Italian, translates as "CI in Luna", e.g. "LuCIna"; the Brembati coat of arms is instead contained in ring of the woman's left forefinger.
<br>
<br>The painting is a bust portrait, with the face slightly from three-quarters. Lucina wears rich clothes with gilt ribbons and shell-shaped embroideries, as well as several jewels including a necklace of pearls, and another with a horn-shaped pendant, which at the time was used as a toothpick.
<br>
<br>Working differently from the idealized portraits <a target="_blank" href="/en/titian">Titian</a> and Palma the Elder had made widespread in Venice, Lotto used a more realistic approach: this is shown is details such as the asymmetric face, the weighty chin, and the sharp nose. In this he followed the local tradition of painters such as Paolo Cavazzola.
<br>
<br>According to some scholars, the man touching the womb could be an allusion to the character's pregnancy state. The dead weasel could also symbolize the defeat of a presage of disgrace for pregnant woman. According to other scholars, the weasel could symbolize marital fidelity. The background includes a heavy red brocade drapery with a night sky.</span>

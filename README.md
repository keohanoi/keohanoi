        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">A limited edition work of art depicting an African American couple standing in front of a church. The stained glass of the church features an African American angel holding a bouquet of roses. It is entitled Mama's House because Mama's faith was strong, she was the spiritual backbone of her home, and she was active in the church and spent as much time doing the work of the Lord as she did in her home.</span>

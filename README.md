        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">Here we see a young girl returning from a public house carefully carrying a gallon jug of beer and three clay pipes up a steep flight of steps. The background is possibly Liverpool but more likely Kirkdale, where Campbell lived, with a view on the left towards the hilltop parish church of Everton and on the right to the sun sinking over the Mersey and the Welsh coastline.
<br>
<br>Campbell regularly composed his pictures using a front-facing figure holding an object.</span>

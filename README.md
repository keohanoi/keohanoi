        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">This mosaic work may have originally been part of a commission by the Curtis Publishing Company in Philadelphia. Naturalistic effects are achieved through glass mosaic that has been cut to various shapes to accommodate the view, including tall slender cypress trees in the background with a multihued sky above. The scene continues with two swans that wade through the rippled pond of shimmering blue. This is an architectural landscape of beauty with classical urns overflowing with pink flowers.</span>

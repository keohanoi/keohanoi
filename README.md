        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">In this self-portrait, Reynolds depicts himself wearing a dark brown jacket with a white ruffled shirt underneath, from the waist up against a black background. The light shining on his face and gray hair draws the viewer's attention, while his left hand is raised and cupping his left ear, suggesting that he is struggling to hear something. This is one of several self-portraits that Reynolds created during his lifetime, revealing the deeply personal and autobiographical way he chose to depict himself. Instead of painting an idealized version of himself, Reynolds provides a realistic portrayal of his hearing loss in his later years.<br><br>This work also showcases Reynolds' mastery of light and shading in portraiture. By using a black background and contrasting it with the light that illuminates his face and hand, Reynolds draws attention to the most significant aspect of the painting - his ear. The piece is imbued with Baroque energy and exemplifies the skilled use of chiaroscuro, demonstrating the influence of artists such as the Italian master Caravaggio on Reynolds' art.</span>

        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">The Madonna of the Carnation, a.k.a. Madonna with Vase or Madonna with Child, is a Renaissance <a target="_blank" href="/en/paintings-by-media/oil-on-sacking">oil painting</a> by <a target="_blank" href="/en/leonardo-da-vinci">Leonardo da Vinci</a> created around 1478-1480. It is permanently displayed at the Alte Pinakothek gallery in Munich, Germany.
<br>
<br>The central and centered motif is the young Virgin Mary seated with Baby Jesus on her lap. Depicted in precious clothes and jewellery, with her left hand Mary holds a carnation (interpreted as a healing symbol). The faces are put into light while all other objects are darker, e.g. the carnation is covered by a shadow. The child is looking up, the mother is looking down — there is no eye contact. The setting of the portrait is a room with two windows on each side of the figures.
<br>
<br>Originally this painting was thought to have been created by <a target="_blank" href="/en/andrea-del-verrocchio">Andrea del Verrocchio</a> but subsequent art historians agree that it is Leonardo's work.
<br>
<br>The Madonna and Child was a common motif in Christian art during the Middle Ages. This painting is the only work by Leonardo which is permanently on display in Germany.</span>

        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">This double image of the American president LB Johnson and the Chinese leader Chairman Mao humorously subverts the official portrait. Although opposed to the apolitical nature of Abstract Expressionism, Dine remained in sympathy with its emphasis on subjective response. In 1966, he dissociated himself from the Pop movement, claiming 'Pop is concerned with exteriors. I'm concerned with interiors'. Compared to Warhol who used screenprinting to detach himself from his subject, here Dine engages directly with his. Touches of colour picks out the features of the face, the rouged cheeks and heavily painted eyes and lips suggest a more personalised satire.</span>

        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">This lovely little painting by the École de Paris artist Jacob Macznik evokes peaceful camaraderie as well as pleasant pastime.  Trompe-l'œil is highly effective without requiring hyper-realism.  The red rim of the small boat is lovely and works especially well to define the space in which the men stand.  One seems actively involved while the other less so at the moment.<br><br>This painting is privately held by the artist's nephew.  Denotation of the copyright is embedded within this low resolution image of the painting.</span>

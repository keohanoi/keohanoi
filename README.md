        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">Set in a shadowy interior, the Virgin has momentarily ceased praying to cover Jesus with a transparent veil as he sleeps in her lap. The iconography alludes to the Passion and death of Christ and to the shroud that will swathe his body, a theme also echoed by the cherries slipping from his hand, prompting us to meditate on this mystery. The window opens out onto a scene of everyday life on a canal, hinting at the presence of the divine in our daily lives.</span>

        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">The artist-designer Louis Comfort Tiffany designed this leaded-glass shade made by his firm Tiffany Glass and Decorating Company around 1899. The shade displays zigzag patterning featured on Native American baskets, which is reinforced by the bold colors of red, black, and yellow. The lamp hung at "Wawapek," the home of Robert and Emily de Forest, in Cold Spring Harbor, New York, across the harbor from Laurelton Hall, Tiffany's country estate. Emily de Forest recalled that her husband had asked Tiffany for a floral shade, to which he responded, "That is not what you need for your hall, you need an Indian Basket." The stylistic motif of the lamp complemented the de Forests' large collection of Native American baskets and Pueblo Indian pottery.</span>

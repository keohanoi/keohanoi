        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">A copy possibly made from the original incomplete work after a fresco by Leonardo da Vinci in the Palazzo della Signoria in Florence, executed in 1504-1505 and destroyed around 1560. <br>In March 2012, it was announced that a team led by Maurizio Seracini has found evidence that the Lost Leonardo still exists on a hidden inner wall behind a cavity, underneath a section of Vasari's fresco in the chamber of Salone dei Cinquecento (Hall of the Five Hundred) in the Palazzo Vecchio, Florence. <br>Its central scene depicted four men riding raging war horses engaged in a battle for possession of a standard, at The Battle of Anghiari in 1440. Purportedly, from left to right are Francesco Piccinino; Niccolò Piccinino; Ludovico Trevisan; Giovanni Antonio Del Balzo Orsini.</span>

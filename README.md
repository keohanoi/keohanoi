He served in Flanders during the later stages of the War of the Austrian Succession (1740–1748), and in 1758 became Colonel of the Royal Regiment of Horse Guards (Blues).

<br>Granby greatly distinguished himself during the Seven Years’ War (1756–1763), commanding the second line of cavalry at the battle of Minden in 1759. In the same year he became Commander-in-Chief of the British forces in Germany following the resignation of Lord George Sackville.</span>

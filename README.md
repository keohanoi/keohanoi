        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">A View of Het Steen in the Early Morning, Château de Steen with Hunter or Het Steen is a landscape painting by <a target="_blank" href="/en/peter-paul-rubens">Rubens</a>, dating to around 1636.
<br>
<br>It measures 131.2&nbsp;cm by 229.2&nbsp;cm and is now in the National Gallery in London.
<br>
<br>A rare example of a work painted for the artist's own pleasure rather than for a commission, it shows a view of the Het Steen estate near Brussels, which he had acquired in 1635, set in an early-morning autumn landscape. He had initially intended a much smaller painting focussing on the house, using three small oak planks, probably spares from his studio – as the concept developed, seventeen more panels were added.
<br>
<br>It has influenced artists including <a target="_blank" href="/en/john-constable">John Constable</a>, during his period working for Sir George Beaumont, who then owned the painting and later donated it to the National Gallery in 1823.
<br>
<br>The painting features the first convincing depiction of a mackerel sky.</span>

        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">The Trinity Altarpiece, also known as the Trinity Altar Panels, is a set of four paintings in oil on wood thought to have been commissioned for the Trinity College Kirk in Edinburgh, Scotland, in the late fifteenth century.
<br>
<br>The work is attributed to the Flemish artist <a target="_blank" href="/en/hugo-van-der-goes">Hugo van der Goes</a> and probably represents the inner and outer panels of the wings of a triptych. The presumed central panel is lost. The painting in the church was described as a "burd" on 17 May 1516 when John Stewart, Duke of Albany made an offering at the high altar on Trinity Sunday.
<br>
<br>The work represents a rare example of Scots religious art to have survived the iconoclasm of the Reformation.
<br>
<br>The panels are part of the British Royal Art Collection and are displayed at the National Gallery of Scotland.
<br>
<br>The four panels depict the following subjects:</span>

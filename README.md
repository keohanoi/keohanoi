        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">Albright was interviewed by Vermont Public Radio in 1978. He says that to make That Which I Should Have Done I Did Not Do, which is 8 feet tall and three feet wide, he cut a hole in the floor of his studio and rested it four feet below the floor, raising and lowering it as he painted. He says he painted about he painted about ½ square inch a day, and never changed anything as he went.
<br>
<br>Here’s what he says about his titles:
<br>
<br>I will tell you why. When I was a boy I met all of these artists and they would have titles like Boys Sitting by a Stream, The Sunshine on the Girl’s Hat, Girl Holding a Daisy, Boy Eating an Apple. I got pretty tired of them. I heard them from 1903 until 1920. I probably was the first one who decided not to have those titles; I was going to have something that the painting said.
<br>
<br>If you know art and like art, you will see so much in it. I thought, to help people along, I would take a title with a little other, you might say, dimension. If, for instance, I bring a picture of Ida into the world, it becomes Into the World There Came a Soul Called Ida. She was a 20-year-old married woman, and I knew they were going to call her a prostitute and ugly, so I called her a soul. Not everybody can call a soul a prostitute.
<br>
<br>I like to get a little bit of my philosophy in the title, and I like That Which I Should Have Done. It happens to almost everybody, almost every day."

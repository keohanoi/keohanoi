Celtic groups from Europe migrated eastward in 279 B.C. and established independent kingdoms in Thrace and central Asia Minor. Known as Galatians, they were used extensively as mercenary soldiers. Inscriptions identifying at least three Galatian soldiers who must have served under the Ptolemies occur on loculus slabs in the rather simple tomb found in 1884.<br><br><a target="_blank" href="https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/247110">The MET</a></span>

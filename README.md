      <p class="description">
        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">During a Viareggio summer in 1919, Balla created a series of about twenty canvases entitled "Force-Lines of the Sea". From this series is Marombra, which features the abstract geometries seen in his Iridescent Interpretations series, along with an element of realistic representation featuring attention to movement and light. The shaped frame of Marombra was painted by Balla himself. </span>

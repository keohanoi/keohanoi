Suit jackets, as a whole, build dramatic extracorporeal form that implies the presence or the absence of human body. Those sequences of a suit jacket, stopped in motion, display various forms of tension provoked by the stance of the society towards an individual. A patchwork suit jacket is displayed in the state of spatial floating implying wasted and faded act. Those forms represent exposed man or the life aspects of an individual through the lens of various social impacts. Hence the existing state of what is left behind speaks of fundamental desolation and the loss of individuality. The introduced forms of a suit jacket in different amorph scenes express methaphysical movement within the space itself. A piece of clothing symbolizes the state between life and death in a space which levitates between the rejected and lost.</span>

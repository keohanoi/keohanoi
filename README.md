        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">The medallions in the frieze on the removable trapezoidal panel dates from around 1200 and features a number of fighting scenes such as the one of two horsemen fighting. Here the artist masterfully depicts one horse moving towards and another jumping away from the beholder. The goldsmith would have seen such naturalistic animal images either in ancient or tenth-century Byzantine works of art. In the case of the horse facing the beholder, the goldsmith achieves a perfect balance between the suggestion of space and surface composition, thereby demonstrating that he was one of the leading artists of the day.</span>

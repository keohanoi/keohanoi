      <p class="description">
        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">In the last decade of his life Bissière became interested in the formal structures of line and colour. During this period the landscape and architectural references he employed in his earlier work became less and less obvious. In their place are more general references to space and atmosphere which are created through the use of translucent colour and a grid structure. The image in this etching is characteristic of his painting at this time.</span>

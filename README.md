        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">The Baptism of Christ was originally commissioned as a triptych by the Camaldolese abbey of San Sepolcro. Although the exact date of the painting is not known, it is thought to be of his early career, as it exhibits the “light painting” technique of Francesca’s teacher, Domenico Veneziano. The painting illustrates Christ being baptized by John, and three angels are standing to the left of the tree, with hands held, symbolizing the unification of the Eastern and Western Churches. Francesca’s knowledge and execution of geometry can be seen in John’s arm and leg, both of which are two angles of the same size. </span>

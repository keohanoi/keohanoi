        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">Portrait of Professor Benjamin H. Rand is an 1874 painting by <a target="_blank" href="/en/thomas-eakins">Thomas Eakins</a>. It is <a target="_blank" href="/en/paintings-by-media/oil-on-sacking">oil</a> on <a target="_blank" href="/en/paintings-by-media/canvas-0">canvas</a> and depicts Benjamin H. Rand, a doctor at Jefferson Medical College who taught Eakins anatomy. In the painting, Rand is reading a book while petting a cat.
<br>
<br>The portrait was the first Eakins made of someone outside his family. It is a prelude to what he considered his most important painting, The Gross Clinic (1875). Rand donated it to Jefferson Medical College when he retired.
<br>
<br>It was purchased by Alice L. Walton for an estimated US$20 million in April 2007, to be housed at the Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art.</span>

        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">On campus in conjunction with the College's Fine Arts Festival, MIT artist Otto Piene lectured and exhibited his kinetic sculptures during the week of Oct. 5-9, 1970. In this photo Piene enlists the help of a number of people to launch his wind sculpture, Sky Ballet, over a pond. The silk tubes are filled with air from canisters on one end and held in place across the pond creating graceful arcs in the air. The October day seems to be chilly, judging from the coats and hats worn by the onlookers. (St. Catherine University Archives)</span>

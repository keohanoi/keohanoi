        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">The <i>Insult</i> is composed of a large number (a heap) of thrown “nude“ dummies, a 150 figures on one pile. The dummies form a heap that implies a theatrical effect of rejected human bodies, a pile of corpses, the remains of a mass atrocity. These are the erased and bleached figures “formed of“ people who no longer have their identity, specific image, and singular character. They represent an allegory of biopolitical thought on the loss of life. The dummies are life-sized and made of white silicone matter which indicates the matter of human body remains. In this pile of dummies, there is a screen that displays short random messages of humiliation and insult.</span>

        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">The artist Israel Tsvaygenbaum always believed that human beings are not single creatures in this universe who have the feelings of love and devotions to each other. This subject unconsciously was always with the artist. In the painting “Wrapped in Love” Israel Tsvaygenbaum depicted a wedding between two trees that were wrapped together in a bridal veil surrounded by nature’s beauty. This painting represents a union that does not need words to express the feeling of love.</span>

        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">Danae was commissioned around 1531 by the Duke of Mantua, Federico Il Gonzaga, as part of a series on the mythical Jupiter’s loves. The painting depicts Danae, the daughter of Acrisius, the king of Argos. According to the legend, Acrisius, hearing from and oracle that Danae’s son would kill him, had his daughter locked in a tower. Jupiter, in the form of a golden rain, came down to Danae and she soon bore a son, Perseus, who eventually killed the king Acrisius. Correggio depicts Jupiter in the form of a golden cloud, floating above the head of Danae, who is being undressed by Eros. </span>

CT scans have shown that Nesmin suffered from arthritis and died as a middle-aged man. They also revealed that thirty-one amulets are still within the wrappings. In addition to a wedjat eye on his forehead, he has an amulet representing the god Thoth on each wrist, and two strings with symmetrically arranged amulets on his torso.<br><br><a target="_blank" href="https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/551162">The Met</a></span>

        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">In this piece, Mondrian’s style is much more fearlessly non-representational. As one of his earlier works, it gives an inkling as to the extent to which the artist was willing to abstract realistic forms in order to suit his own artistic tastes. During the time this painting was created, Mondrian began developing his philosophical ideas on theosophy and anthroposophy, two spiritual movements which allowed Mondrian to see painting as a search for spiritual knowledge within oneself. Although his earlier works depicted dim figures or abstracted colors, his search for spiritual enlightenment within and throughout his paintings was to lead through a pathway of more abstract forms. </span>

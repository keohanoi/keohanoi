        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">The two gnarled oak trees, brightly illuminated by a few rays of sunlight, stand out sharply against the threatening sky. Van Goyen drew the trees with his brush. He used thin, almost transparent paint for the foliage and thick, grainy paint for the furrowed trunks. The landscape’s near monochrome palette is enlivened by the blue and red doublets of the two figures resting.</span>

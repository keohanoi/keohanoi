        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">The Portrait of a Man is a painting by the Italian Renaissance artist <a target="_blank" href="/en/luca-signorelli">Luca Signorelli</a>, dated to c. 1492 and housed in the Gemäldegalerie, Berlin.
<br>
<br>In 1490-1492 Signorelli was in Volterra, a city under Florentine control, under the patronage of the House of Medici. Here he painted an Annunciation, a Virgin Enthroned with Saints, a Circumcision of Christ and, perhaps, this painting, attributed to that period for its stylistic resemblance with those works.
<br>
<br>The painting portrays an aged man from three-quarters, characterized by white hair and rich bourgeois garments, perhaps those of a jurist, including a red beret and jacket, and a black scarf. The style is inspired to the works of <a target="_blank" href="/en/hans-memling">Hans Memling</a> and to some by <a target="_blank" href="/en/domenico-ghirlandaio">Domenico Ghirlandaio</a>.
<br>
<br>The background houses Roman ruins and some naked men, inspired to those in <a target="_blank" href="/en/piero-della-francesca">Piero della Francesca</a>'s Death of Adam in San Francesco at Arezzo, and are also in other works by Signorelli, such as the Madonna with Child and Naked Men of the Uffizi.</span>

        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">Artschwager's work explores recognition and perception as integral steps in the subjective cognitive process. In Interior, through its implied sequential alteration of perspective, he animates the space of one room by moving the viewer through space and time in a cinematic fashion. Each panel stands for the viewer's partial view of the space, yet in juxtaposition a larger sense of the room is revealed. Artschwager uses such effects to depict common objects or places, but his subjects take on enigmatic and mysterious overtones through these subtle explorations of perception and through his muted palette and strangely irregular surfaces. Interior offers a mystifying visual experience of a seemingly ordinary Victorian living room divorced from reality and evoking nostalgia. (Raimond Livasgani)</span>

        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">This is a fine example of the middle stages of Giordano's career. The work shows a richness and dynanism in the figures along with a decorative nature that dominated the Baroque period in painting. This picture is the only surviving set of four paintings by Giordano fo Charless II of Spain to commemorate the victory of Messina over the French army.</span>

Where Are We Going?</i> (1897-98) was created in Tahiti during a time of the artist's great personal crisis. Struggling to find recognition and success in Paris, Gauguin decided to move permanently to Tahiti in 1895. There he continued to struggle: plagued by illness and mounting debt, his mental health rapidly deteriorated. Around the same time, he learned that his beloved daughter Aline died of pneumonia. At this low point, he summoned his strength to paint <i>Where Do We Come From? What Are We? Where Are We Going?</i>, a masterpiece that was a summation of his artistic ideas. He wrote: “I have put all my energy into it one more time before I die, so painful a passion in such dreadful circumstances, so clear and accurate a vision, that there is no trace of precociousness and life blossoms forth from it”.<br><br>The painting, which should be viewed from right to left, represents the spectrum of human activity throughout one’s life, from birth to death. The thread of the composition corresponds with the questions posed in the title of the painting, Where Do We Come From? What Are We? Where Are We Going? The boundaries of the scene are marked by the newborn child lying in the grass on the right, and the haggard old woman, who glumly reflects on the past. Between these two, Gauguin creates a dreamlike vision that describes the daily existence of adulthood. In the background, he included a couple walking and an exotic blue idol, which, according to Gauguin, symbolized ‘the Beyond'. The large canvas features some of Gauguin’s favorite subjects, such as the reclining nude, the group of figures lost in thought, and the cult statue.<br><br>The painting expressed Gauguin’s highly personal mythology, which was developed through the combination and adaption of symbols from a variety of Western and non-Western sources. In particular, the scene reflects the influence of Tahiti, its tropical landscape, and native Polynesian culture. Gauguin wanted the painting to evoke associative meanings, rather than explain explicitly the meaning of his symbolism. His symbolism expressed the inner world of visions and emotions, which was purposefully enigmatic and ambiguous. Gauguin wanted to interpret life as a great mystery, and in the painting, he emphasized the lack of understanding of the world.<br><br>After he completed the painting, Gauguin sent it to Paris to the art collector George-Daniel de Monfreid. Shortly after the artist retreated to the hills where he intended to poison himself by drinking arsenic. Gauguin’s suicide attempt failed, and he gradually recovered in the hospital. In the meantime, Monfried managed to sell the painting for a thousand francs, something that helped Gauguin’s spirits. Today the painting is part of the collection of the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston.</span>

        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">Long before installation art was the norm, Salvador Dali created perhaps the first example at the 1939 World’s Fair that was held in Flushing Meadows in Queens, New York.<br><br>The 1939 World’s Fair sounds incredible. Franklin Delano Roosevelt and Albert Einstein spoke, Vermeer’s <a target="_blank" href="https://www.wikiart.org/en/johannes-vermeer/the-milkmaid"><i>The Milkmaid</i></a> (c.1660) and the <i>Magna Carta</i> were on display, Westinghouse buried a time capsule to be open in 6939 AD (some contents include writings by Einstein and Thomas Mann, a pack of Camel cigarettes, microfilm with texts, seeds, and a Mickey Mouse watch). The fair debuted color photography, nylon, air conditioning, the View-Master and Smell-o-Vision, and had “zones” debuted “future technologies” by companies like GM and Frigidaire.<br><br>Dali’s pavilion was entitled <i>Dream of Venus</i>, and it created a surrealist dream world. Patrons entered through a pair of women’s legs (John Malkovich copied this for his Lisbon Nightclub called <i>Lux</i>) and purchased tickets from a fish head booth. Dali designed two pools where topless sirens and mermaids swam about, women dressed as pianos and lobsters cavorted amongst paintings and props in front of a giant four-paneled painting by Dali and other tableaus with costumes designed by Dali.<br><br>Sadly, creative compromise happened even then. The fair organizers made major modifications to Dali’s original ideas, which caused him to dramatically write a pamphlet called <i>Declaration of the Independence of the Imagination and the Rights of Man to His Own Madness</i>. Although Dali wasn’t thoroughly satisfied, the exhibition brought <a target="_blank" href="https://www.wikiart.org/en/artists-by-art-movement/surrealism">Surrealism</a> and Dali’s creative ideas out of the artistic world and to the masses.</span>

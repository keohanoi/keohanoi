        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">Hakone, 10th Station of the Tokaido depicts the lush green mountainsides, jagged untamed cliff faces, overgrown wild flora and the iconic Mount Fuji sitting valiantly in the background, all of which you can still see today. Look closely and you’ll see this deeply detailed painting continues to follow the daimyo procession en-route to the next station.  A mix of still landscape and character movement it’s an ideal harmony of Hiroshige’s woodblock print techniques.</span>

        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">This works starts from a love letter written on Christmas day 1917, in a mental hospital of southern Italy by Paolina T, a 20-years-old girl, interned because she was “poor” - so it was written in her record - and homosexual.<br><i>The foundations of light</i> is a work about the unsuppressible brightness that harbor in the depth of the human being and that is the engine of existence even in the dark. This installation is an elegy suspended between the spiritual and the politic. This last aspect becomes very powerful, explicit, and provoking. Does not exist, in fact, private without public and salvation cannot be but a collective, social, class action. As Paolina T. is poor, she’s forced to write her love letter in the hell of a mental hospital of early 1900. Though it is not so different from the present world, which is a large cage for brains from which you can escape only becoming lighter.<br><br>( Santa Maria della Fede, Napoli)</span>

        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">In the late 1930s, Lee Krasner-who was already well ingrained in New York's art community-began producing works that used ordinary objects as springboards for abstract compositions. In Still Life she revels in the precise relationships between color, form, and the white of the untouched paper, or negative space. In 1937 Krasner enrolled in classes with Hans Hofmann, as did several other artists whose work is featured in this exhibition. Hofmann, who was among the first modernist art teachers in the United States, stressed the importance of negative space in establishing visual structure. Krasner readily absorbed this lesson even as she created work far more radical than that of her teacher at the time.<br>Source: Whitney Museum of American Art,<br>Labyrinth of Forms: Women and Abstraction, 1930–1950<br>Oct 9, 2021–Mar 13, 2022</span>

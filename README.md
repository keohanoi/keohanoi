        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">Saint Augustine in His Study, is a painting by the Italian Renaissance master <a target="_blank" href="/en/sandro-botticelli">Sandro Botticelli</a>, finished around 1490-1494. It is housed in the Uffizi, in Florence.
<br>
<br>This work was probably executed for an Augustinian hermit of Santo Spirito, as shown by the fact the saint wears both episcopal and hermit garments.
<br>
<br>As many of Botticelli's late works, it is inspired by the preaching of Savonarola.</span>

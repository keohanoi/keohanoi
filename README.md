This painting depicts the wealthy Roman woman Algae and her concubine slave Boniface, here living as pagan sinners in Rome around AD 290. On a trip to Tarsus on the Anatolian coast, Boniface converted to Christianity and was tortured and beheaded. Algae also converted to Christianity, gave all her possessions to the poor, and built a church for Boniface's relics.</span>

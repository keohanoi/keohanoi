        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">This work resembles the cross-section of a tree trunk, or an eye, but is impossible to pin down precisely. Like many of Wols' drawings and paintings, it combines abstraction and figuration. One source for the image might be a photograph taken by Wols that shows a cut of meat, exposing the joint. Wols lived in southern France during the Second World War and its aftermath, making paintings that became progressively smaller. This tiny work was probably painted towards the end of that period.</span>

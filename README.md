        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">'Horse In Landscape' (1910) is one of the earliest works where Franz Marc, inspired by Kandinsky, experiments with colors. In this painting, there's a purple horse with a blue mane and tail looking over a landscape defined by yellow, red, green and blue areas. The horse is standing with its back to the observer, so that it can take the viewer's perspective.</span>

        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">A waiting room is a room where time or life, seem suspended. We are temporarily put in a situation where we cannot act. And we do not have to. It is not expected of us. It offers a moment for contemplation, with responsibility temporarily lifted.<br>We like to think that we make choices in life, decisions made by our free will. But perhaps our sense of control is an illusion. Ultimately there is the fear, the<br>realisation even, that everything is pointless, that all is in vain. What if waiting is in fact all we are capable of ?</span>

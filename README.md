        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">Mackintosh and Margaret Macdonald lived at Walberswick, Suffolk from 1914-5. Mackintosh focussed on painting watercolours of flowers and the local landscape. Blackshore on the Blyth is a small fishing village on the north bank of the river Blyth, near Walberswick. The tower of Southwold Church, simplified by Mackintosh, can be seen in the background. The composition and the title suggest the influence of the American painter, J. M. Whistler.</span>

        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">Ashton's 'Sentry-box Reach' was painted when he was a staff artist for The picturesque atlas of Australasia; a position which allowed him to travel widely. The Hawkesbury soon became a favourite haunt for painting. He returned to it frequently with artist friends. 'Sentry-box Reach' is a classic example of nineteenth-century British watercolour technique – transparent washes of watercolour over barely perceptible pencil outlines, occasionally with some minor scraping out for highlights. It is a particularly convincing study of the expanse and conditions of the Hawkesbury landscape.</span>

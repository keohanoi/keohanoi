        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">One of Rauschenberg's first "combines," <i>Bed</i> transcends the line between painting and sculpture through its <a target="_blank" href="https://www.wikiart.org/en/paintings-by-style/dada#!#resultType:masonry">Dadaist</a> assemblage of traditional materials and the detritus of everyday life. Rauschenberg coined the term <i>combine</i> to describe a series of works from the 1950s and 1960s that literally combine the media of painting and sculpture within a single, three-dimensional art object. Apocryphal or not, the legend behind the combine states that one day Rauschenberg ran out of canvas and turned instead to his bed linens, first scribbling on the pillow, sheets, and quilt with pencil, then rapidly dripping and spilling paint on them. He then stretched the bed linens over a rectangular wooden support, in the place of a canvas, and attached the pillow and quilt in a way that made it appear as if the bed was made with only one corner un-tucked. He applied the paint in a loose, dripped, gestural fashion that calls to mind the authorial marks of <a target="_blank" href="https://www.wikiart.org/en/jackson-pollock#!#resultType:masonry">Jackson Pollock</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.wikiart.org/en/willem-de-kooning#!#resultType:masonry">Willem de Kooning</a>. However, the brushstroke in the combine was no longer a mark indicative of the artist's psyche, but an appropriated symbol designating a shift towards the external world within the avant-garde. The found objects present more of an accurate portrait of Rauschenberg than the dripped paint, as they were items that he owned and used in his daily life, rather than an aesthetic sign borrowed from a previous generation.<br><br><a target="_blank" href="https://www.theartstory.org/artist-rauschenberg-robert-artworks.htm">theartstory.org</a></span>

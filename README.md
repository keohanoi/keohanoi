        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">Jackson Pollock’s Mural represents the break from representational painting on traditional canvases to his unique drip style, completed on canvases stretched out on the floor. He assimilated painting techniques from Pablo Picasso, Thomas Hart Benton, and David Alfaro Siquieros, as well as Native American sand painting techniques to form his own unique drip style, which sometimes included sand or chards of glass, combined with enamel house paint, loosely dripped, squirted, and flung across his canvas or board. This painting, commissioned by Peggy Guggenheim, measured around 8 by 20 feet, and was Pollock’s first large-scale work completed in this manner. </span>

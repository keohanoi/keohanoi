        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">The mystic visions of Hildegard of Bingen have been genially rendered in the miniatures of this manuscript. The picture on folio 91r illustrates the second vision: the divine power of creation with the universe and man as symbol of the cosmos. Adam as Mankind appears within the cosmic sphere. On the bottom left sits Hildegard, at once authoress and visionary.

<br>The manuscript at Lucca is an early thirteenth-century illustrated copy of Hildegard's work.</span>

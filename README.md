All around it there were traces of people who today take shelter from cold. Watching the context I thought that the memory of a bed on which generations of mads slept in the earliest ‘900 could be so strong that who sleeps there now could continue to dream the same dreams of all the people who passed years on that bed. So I built a weave of yarn suspended over that bed like a trace of a thready dream. (This work is part of the cycle <i>Considerations...</i>)</span>

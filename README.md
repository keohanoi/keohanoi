      <p class="description">
        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">Charred Journal is executed in the traditional Abstract Expressionist style, and draws from the all-over style of Pollock's action painting. At only about two feet wide, the painting is dwarfed by some of Louis' Unfurleds, which measure over twenty feet horizontally. However, Louis manages to achieve a remarkable sense of dynamism within a relatively compact space. This canvas predates Louis' exposure to Helen Frankenthaler's stain paintings, after which he began his Veil series and mature Color Field work. </span>

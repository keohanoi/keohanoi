        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">Monument to the Five Senses (German: Denkmal für die fünf Sinne) is a 1991 metal sculpture by <a target="_blank" href="/en/lubo-kristek">Lubo Kristek</a>, installed outside the Neues Stadtmuseum, Landsberg am Lech, Germany in 1992. This tribute to human senses is made using repoussé and chasing technique, and is composed of welded sheets of metal.<br>
<br>
<br>Inspired by human senses and crossmodal perception, Kristek executed this sculpture in one of his typical techniques – from welded sheets of metal that he formed using repoussé and chasing technique. <br>
<br>
<br>The piece depicts five human senses that conjoin in a face-like shape and resemble a growing plant. The hand is open. Kristek’s artistic life was permeated by experiments with perception. He meant some of his performances, e. g. Promenade with a Neurotic Fox (1975), as studies of perception and behaviour of crowd. Later, Kristek’s ideas evolved in his theory that various types of stimuli entangle and excite a holographic image in the mind of the spectator. He called it  holographic perception. <br>
<br>
<br>The sculptural piece was commissioned by Beatrix und Erich Matthees (the Lechstadt Hausbau company) and donated to the Neues Stadtmuseum.<br>
<br>
<br>In November 1992, the sculpture was inaugurated in the museum’s garden as an introduction to Kristek’s solo retrospective exhibition in the Neues Stadtmuseum starting on 12 December. <br>
<br>
<br>In 2015, the artwork was included in the selection of Neues Stadtmuseum’s 40 treasures described  in the publication Schätze aus den städtischen Sammlungen des Neuen Stadtmuseums Landsberg am Lech (Treasures of the Municipal Collection in the Neues Stadtmuseum Landsberg am Lech).<br></span>

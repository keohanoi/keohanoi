        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">Arne Quinze has been exploring the mosaic technique for a few years now. The organic feel of this manual working process has always attracted him as a medium to create art with. He kept this particular art work in his atelier in Sint-Martens-Latem for several years, as an inspirational piece to explore the translation of the 'My Secret Garden' paintings to mosaic. It is made with a variation of clean and rough Murano glass.</span>

        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">One of his earlier works, Going West is an example of Pollock’s early interests and painting style, as well as his own personal history. It has been suggested that this painting was inspired by a family photo of a bridge in Pollock’s birthplace, Cody, Wyoming. As an image of a pioneering family moving west, perhaps it is also a personal statement of the fact that his family moved west to Arizona and then later California when he was a child. The painting also exhibits the influence on Pollock’s style by his mentor Thomas Hart Benton, who was an American Regionalist painter.</span>

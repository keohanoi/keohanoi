        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe"> Most of Pasmore's 'square motif' works date from 1948-50. They are constructions of found elements such as spirals, rectangles, triangles and circles which, although they suggest nature, are not obviously descriptive. The way the elements are combined suggested particular associations or emotions to the artist as he worked. Although he sought to organize and unite the compositions, he has stressed that he wished to express human feelings, not abstract ideas.</span>

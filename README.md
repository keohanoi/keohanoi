        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">A limited-edition work of art depicting a young African American boy tending to some chickens in the field. In the background, you will find a shotgun shack, farmhouse, city buildings and the White House. The young child has dreams of achieving so much in his lifetime and this image was created to remind us that where you start has nothing to do with where you finish. It is also meant to show how far our people have come. From slavery and the outhouse all the way to the White House.</span>

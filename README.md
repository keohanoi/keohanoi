        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">Arp felt that modern society had become over-dependent on reason. He hoped to redress the balance by developing an art that consciously evoked the forms and laws of nature without copying them. The rounded shapes in this relief may suggest clouds or planets, while the ‘laws’ of the title are those of flux and chance that characterise the ‘inaccessible order’ of nature. Arp’s interest in chance extended to the making of his reliefs. He ordered them from a craftsman, but left his instructions ambiguous in order to encourage the craftsman's free interpretation.</span>

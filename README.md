It represents the most peripherical rooms of the inner castle described by Sancta Teresa of Avila, those in which one lives almost outside of his own soul.<br><br>The installation has been made in a church closed since WWII, in the middle of a complex neighborhood of Naples. The main subject is the plague as an analogy of unconsciousness, a disease of the spirit which has killed an entire generation, as, in the past, other metaphoric (like nazism according to Albert Camus) of physical pestilences (like those told by Tacitus, Boccaccio or Manzoni).<br><br>(Chiesa dei SS. Cosma e Damiano, Napoli)</span>

        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">This installation is part of a larger project called <i>I’ve already been here</i>. It is a cycle of works centering around the sense of solitude in a city like New York, where every year thousands of people go to find their luck. They bring with them dreams and memories. <i>Apt #102</i> attempts to reflect on what remains of all these people when they leave. The work is developed in an entire residential building, through all the common areas, and in an apartment temporarily empty. Inside the apartment the few traces of the old tenant are visible. There are the imprints of the furniture on the floor and some echo of a memory, like a sink upside down, dripping and slowly flooding the room, erasing everything. These fading traces look frozen a moment before they disappear forever because they are the only thing that most people leave in the city.</span>

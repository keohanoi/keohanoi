The boy holds a lance and supports the soldier's large oval shield against his chest. Almost all the preserved evidence for painting in the Hellenistic period comes from funerary monuments. Some like the vaulted tombs of Macedonia and Thrace show large scale figures and friezes. More modest painted stelai like the ones displayed here have been found in many places in the Eastern Meditereanean.<br><br><a target="_blank" href="https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/247111">The MET</a></span>

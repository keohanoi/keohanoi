        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">One of the themes that gave Murillo his most success was the Immaculate Conception, and this is one beautiful example of his talent. The image shows the Virgin Mary, surrounded by a fleet of angels, floating upon the clouds. Although many of his paintings depicted a strong version of reality, this painting soars in imagination, the Virgin clothed in light, a halo shining from the top of her head. The many angels, who drift around her in a playful manner, look upon her as if she is a precious relic to be revered and protected. Some of the others reach out to touch her in a playful manner, as if she is already their mother. </span>

        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">John Milton’s epic poem Paradise Lost, describing the Christian story of Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden, and the ensuing fall of man, is considered one of the greatest pieces of literature in the English language. It has inspired many visual artists to engage in creating the imagery of the poem. The first illustrated version of the poem appeared in the fourth edition of the work, in 1688, and later, other artists, such as William Blake and Salvador Dali have been inspired to create illustrations inspired by the work. Dore’s illustrations of Paradise Lost were some of his later works, and also some of the most famous. </span>

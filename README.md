        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">Cupid and Psyche is a 1638–40 painting by <a target="_blank" href="/en/anthony-van-dyck">Anthony van Dyck</a>. It is now in the Royal Collection and shown in Kensington Palace. Psyche may be modelled on van Dyck's mistress Margaret Lemon.
<br>
<br>One of the last in his oeuvre, it shows a marked influence of <a target="_blank" href="/en/titian">Titian</a> and dates from his time as a court artist to Charles I of England. It is his sole surviving mythological painting from that period and possibly comes from a series of paintings on the Cupid and Psyche theme ordered for the Queen's House at Greenwich - other artists involved in the series included <a target="_blank" href="/en/jacob-jordaens">Jacob Jordaens</a> and van Dyck's old tutor <a target="_blank" href="/en/peter-paul-rubens">Peter Paul Rubens</a>. That project never came to completion, which is one possible explanation for why the painting has no frame and is relatively unfinished. This would date it to 1638–1640. A second alternative is that it was produced for the celebrations of Princess Mary's marriage to William II of Orange in 1641.</span>

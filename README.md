        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">“Conjured Melodies” is a painting about the melody of love and beauty. A conjured melody of love allows a bride to fly. The fiddler takes you away with a feeling of love and spirit. Sometimes in Israel Tsvaygenbaum's dreams, he sees himself as a fiddler. The artist never knew how to play violin, but he always loved the music of a violin. Working on Conjured Melodies allowed him to be the fiddler in his dream that played for a bride in his painting. Until the bride flies the artist will continue to be her fiddler.</span>

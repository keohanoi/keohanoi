        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">Slaughtered Ox, also known as Flayed Ox, Side of Beef, or Carcass of Beef, is a 1655 oil on beech panel <a target="_blank" href="/en/paintings-by-genre/still-life">still life</a> painting by <a target="_blank" href="/en/rembrandt">Rembrandt</a>. It has been in the collection of the Louvre in Paris since 1857. A similar painting is in Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum, possibly by Rembrandt himself but probably by one of his pupils, perhaps <a target="_blank" href="/en/carel-fabritius">Fabritius</a>. Other similar, paintings attributed to Rembrandt or his circle, are held by museums in Budapest and Philadelphia.
<br>
<br>The work follows in a tradition of artworks showing butchery, for example <a target="_blank" href="/en/pieter-aertsen">Pieter Aertsen</a>'s A Meat Stall with the Holy Family Giving Alms (1551) and <a target="_blank" href="/en/annibale-carracci">Annibale Carracci</a>'s Butcher's Shop (c.1583), and perhaps more specifically Joachim Beuckelaer's Slaughtered Pig (1563) or . Rembrandt made a drawing of a similar scene c.1635. Another, pre-1655, painting of a slaughtered ox (the example in Edinburgh, now attributed to Rembrandt's circle but formerly to Rembrandt) was perhaps inspired by a lost earlier work by Rembrandt himself. In northern Europe, the month of November was traditionally the season slaughtering livestock in northern Europe, before winter made feed difficult to find.
<br>
<br>The <a target="_blank" href="/en/paintings-by-genre/still-life">still life</a> painting measures 95.5 by 68.8 centimetres (37.6&nbsp;in ×&nbsp;27.1&nbsp;in), and is signed and dated "Rembrandt f. 1655". It shows a butchered carcass of a large bovine, a bull or an ox, hanging in a wooden building, possibly a stable or lean-to shed. The carcass is suspended by its two rear legs, which are tied by ropes to a wooden crossbeam. The animal has been decapitated and flayed of skin and hair, the chest cavity has been stretched open and the internal organs removed, revealing a mass of flesh, fat, connective tissue, joints, bones, and ribs. The carcass is carefully coloured, and given textures by impasto. In the background, a woman's head and body of a woman appear at a door, lifting the painting from <a target="_blank" href="/en/paintings-by-genre/still-life">still life</a> into a <a target="_blank" href="/en/paintings-by-genre/genre-painting">genre painting</a>, a scene of normal everyday life. It is sometimes considered a <a target="_blank" href="/en/paintings-by-genre/vanitas">vanitas</a> or memento mori; some commentators make references to the killing of the fatted calf in the biblical story of the Prodigal Son, others directly to the Crucifixion of Jesus.
<br>
<br>The painting was possibly owned by Christoffel Hirschvogel in 1661. It was viewed by <a target="_blank" href="/en/joshua-reynolds">Joshua Reynolds</a> in the collection of Pieter Locquet in Amsterdam in 1781, and later owned by Louis Viardot, who sold it to the Louvre in 1857 for 5,000 francs.
<br>
<br>The work's muscular meatiness inspired a series of works the French painter <a target="_blank" href="/en/chaim-soutine">Chaim Soutine</a>, and in turn the English painter <a target="_blank" href="/en/francis-bacon">Francis Bacon</a>, most particularly Bacon's Figure with Meat, in which be depicts Pope Innocent X, as painted by Velazquez, accompanied by ghostly echoes of the carcass from Rembrandt's painting.</span>

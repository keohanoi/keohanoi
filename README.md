        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">Created in 1444, this painting is one of the mature works of Jacopo Bellini. Annunciation is a panel, which is a permanent part of the exhibition of Sant Allesandro, Brescia, along with many other works from the early Renaissance period. This painting is a beautiful example of Bellini’s incorporation of Byzantine and Gothic techniques with the new style of Renaissance painting, which included the vibrant colors of Venetian painting and decorative clothing and textural patterns. </span>

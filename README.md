        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">The Bella Apartment house was newly constructed in 1878 when Tiffany and his young family moved into a top-floor apartment. Tiffany was able to decorate his apartment, in which the interiors paid homage to the Aesthetic movement in their forms and decoration, uniting Japanese, Islamic, and Indian cultures. The interior also heeded progressive design, as demonstrated by one of the few surviving objects from this interior, the abstract window from the entrance hall. This remarkable and most personal leaded-glass window is an example of nonrepresentational work from Tiffany's formative years.</span>

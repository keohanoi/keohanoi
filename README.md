        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">Krasner's use of hard edges in Mysteries is not only reminiscent of the art of indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest, but also a tribute to the collages of Henri Matisse, who Krasner much admired. Krasner's use of contrasting reds and grays and this piece further add to its strong, decisive feel.

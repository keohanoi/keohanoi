        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">This work reproduced a familiar livingroom, spatialized on a marble platform of 2.370sq/ft. The furniture is burnt until the limit of its structural strength. The reflection of this work starts from the idea that what you gained in the past can’t be taken away from you. The truth is that each time you try to take your past back, it reveals itself as a fragile shape. If you touch it, it will become ash into your own hands.<br><br>(Tenuta dello Scompiglio, Lucca)</span>

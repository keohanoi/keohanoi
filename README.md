        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">This is a painting purely about greed. A snake is often seen a guardian or a ominous protector of a object or place, and in this instance it is entwined with the old South Africa and its mineral wealth. It resembles the snakes found with party packs, and wears a comical hat with a flag, and hisses, a warning to anyone interfering with the state of affairs. Even though the old South Africa flag and ZA, as seen on stickers identifying South African cars, are prominent, I am also drawing attention to universal greed where money, investments, gold and silver are of extraordinary importance because they are manifestations of power.</span>

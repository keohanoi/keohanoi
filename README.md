        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">Originally this artwork was developed in an inner wall of a former prison known as Palacio de Lecumberri in Mexico. Rodríguez Lozano was imprisoned under the charges of stealing some engravings (of Guido Reni and Albrecht Dürer) of the San Carlos Academy of Art, where he was Headmaster. After some months and a non-guilty verdict he was released. There he began his white period.<br><br>This piece is very significant inside the entire corpus of his work. This is one of his two mural-works and because it was relocated, it may be admired at the Palacio de Bellas Artes in Mexico City</span>

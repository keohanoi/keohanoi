        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">Another of Monet’s series of paintings, the Poplar paintings were painted in the summer and fall of 1891. The poplars trees were located on the banks of a river a few miles up the river from Monet’s home in Giverny, France, in a marsh. Monet had to reach his painting studio, which was floating outside along the bank of the trees, by going upriver in a small boat. The trees that were the subject of the paintings were actually put up for sale by the city of Limetz, who owned them, and Monet actually bought the trees so he could continue his paintings of them. After his series was finished, he sold the trees to a lumber company who wanted them for harvest. </span>

        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">The title of this work refers to Louis Daguerre, one of the nineteenth-century inventors of photography. The soup concocted in his name is represented by a chart of its ingredients. However, these ingredients are themselves photographs, whether of 'real' vegetables or of fish made of tissue paper. A label presents the work as if it were a museum exhibit, implying that it belongs to the distant past, perhaps even to Daguerre's era. Although the soup can never be eaten, the photographic images survive in a state of pristine freshness long after 'real' vegetables would have rotted away.</span>

        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">Portrait of Philibert Rivière is a c. 1805 oil on canvas painting by the French <a target="_blank" href="/en/artists-by-art-movement/neoclassicism">Neoclassical</a> artist Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres. It was commissioned by Philibert Rivière de L'Isle, an influential court official in the in Napoleonic Empire, along with portraits of his wife, Philibert and their daughter, Caroline.
<br>
<br>The couple also has a son, Paul, who was not portrayed. The three portraits comprised Ingres' first major commission, were completed when he was c 23 years old. They are each very different in tone and approach, but were highly successful from an artistic point of view, and all considered among his early masterpieces.
<br>
<br>As an official commission, the painting is very different from Ingres' earlier male portraits, which were mostly informal descriptions of friends. Philibert is shown in an official pose, sitting on a highly ornate and expensive chair, and posed beside a table draped with a red velvet cloth, and containing documents related to his office. His hand is tucked inside his vest, in a pose reminiscent of Napoleon. 
<br>
<br>The painting was influences by the work of <a target="_blank" href="/en/jacques-louis-david">Jacques-Louis David</a>, in particular his amiable portraits of Pierre Sériziat and Gaspar Mayer. Here Rivière may appear imposing, while also relaxed and friendly. The painting is very flat and spatially restrictive.
<br>
<br>Unusually for Ingres, there are no surviving preparatory sketches. The artist signed and dated the canvas at the lower left.</span>

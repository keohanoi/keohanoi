        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">'This work represents the distillation of the kind of art painters are aiming at when they avoid perspective. The title, The Thinker, which I gave this humble piece ironically, contrasts with the feeling of Rodin's Thinker, which belongs to a different world. As I progressed with this style, I began to see the rights and wrongs of those who agree and those who disagree. I realized only quite late that it is very difficult to combine the two styles: the style of drawing that takes account of chiaroscuro, and what may be called the oriental approach, which contains within it the quality of the colour scales. This work was painted in reaction to my academic studies and tradition.'

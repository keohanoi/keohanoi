        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">This was made shortly after Pasmore's first abstract collage, during a transitional phase in his career. The structures and patterns, shapes and colours of his landscape - inspired paintings had evolved into a formal vocabulary, and Pasmore began to work in a more abstract manner. While he was also making paintings based on square or spiral forms, a major line of investigation during this time was collage in the Cubist manner, which he developed between 1949-53. Here he used scraps of coloured paper and newsprint to give a new reality, that is an anti-illusionistic content, to his compositions. </span>

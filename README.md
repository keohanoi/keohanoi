        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">This wall construction consists of various found elements with a mirror placed in the center. The name suggests a personal connection with Kaprow, though the photographs are of unknown figures. When catching their reflection, the viewer is unwittingly implicated in a participatory role, completing the piece. <i>Grandma's Boy</i> uses participation to give meaning to its form and illustrates Kaprow's move towards a more personal focus in his work.</span>

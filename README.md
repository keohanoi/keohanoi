        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">His famous work Tale of a Girl and a Peacock unites organically the mysterious symbolism of the subject (the peacock being the embodiment of eternal dream of the beautiful) with poetry of Ukrainian folklore and national painting traditions. Decorative flatness of painting with accentuated fine line drawing, the use of tempera and panel remind of old icon painting whose traditions the artist transformed so brilliantly in his sacral art. </span>

It reveals the influence of Leonardo's 'Virgin of the Rocks' in its solemn but smiling faces and its dark setting.<br><br>Another version is in the Fogg Art Museum (Cambridge, Mass.). The different flowers in the foreground (including lupin, dandelion, columbine, wheat and violet) probably have symbolic significance.</span>

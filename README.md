The painting was commissioned by Huntington Hartford, an American businessman, who was heir to the A&amp;P Supermarket, for the opening of his museum, Gallery of Modern Art, in New York. The museum was located on Columbus circle, hence the inspiration for the subject of the painting. As a devout Roman Catholic, Dali portrayed Columbus as the Christian savior, bringing the true church and salvation to the new world. The painting now resides at the Salvador Dali Museum, in St. Petersburg, Florida. </span>

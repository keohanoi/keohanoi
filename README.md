        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">Jacqueline Kennedy personally sought out Aaron Shikler to do a posthumous portrait of JFK after his assassination on November 22, 1963. It was the first time in history a presidential portrait was attempted without a living president to pose for it. Shikler derived the pose from a photograph of Senator Edward M. Kennedy taken at his brother's grave. "Since he was President during a turbulent time in American history, Aaron Shikler felt Kennedy should be remembered in that famous posthumous pose, with his eyes down and arms folded while clearly deep in thought about the challenges facing the nation he loved so dearly."</span>

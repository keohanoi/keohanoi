        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">The work, executed between 1840 and 1842, is full of erudite references to the Italian and European pictorial tradition: from reflections on the 16th-century painting of the Veneto exemplified by the treatment of the clothing, which echoes the textural effects of Savoldo and Titian, to the citation of Flemish still lifes.<br>Painted for Marquis Filippo Ala Ponzoni, a patron of the arts, patriot and follower of Giuseppe Mazzini, this picture owed its popularity both to its outstanding quality and to its emblematic value, making it a symbol of the restlessness of Romanticism. The subject belongs to the half-figure category inspired by the 17th century Emilian school’s Sibyllas and Cleopatras which Hayez revisited with a greater focus on the figures’ moods. The wilting flowers also remind us of the transcience of human affairs.<br>The painting was bequeathed to Brera in 1889 by Marchese Ala Ponzoni.</span>

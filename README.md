        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe"> «Magie à la noix» means something like “mumbo-jumbo”; the title refers to the alleged fetish character of the objects. They were created on the Greek island Symi, where Daniel Spoerri retreated to for a year after feeling that as an artist he was being defined to closely with his snare-pictures. The barrenness and the poverty of the island made the gluing of tableware to a surface seem inappropriate, even impossible. There was hardly any trash. Everything stayed in use as long as possible. Spoerri concentrated on the simplest found objects and produced a series of compact, relatively small fetish-like objects. Today the whole series is located at the Museum Schloss Morsbroich in Leverkusen</span>

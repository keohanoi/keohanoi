        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">Painted while the artist was living in Paris, Gare Montparnasse (The Melancholy of Departure), illustrates many recurring themes in De Chirico’s works. In addition to the long shadows and vast expanse of open space, a typical style in which De Chirico painted, this work also includes the theme of railway travel or transportation. As evidenced by the name, many of De Chirico’s works were inspired by the feelings evoked by travel and departure. This painting also includes a bunch of bananas in the foreground, another recurring theme in De Chirico’s paintings. The artist produced another painting with the same title, although the subject are far some similar. </span>

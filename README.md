        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">The Battle of the Amazons or Amazonomachia is an oil on wood painting produced around 1615. It shows an amazonomachy. It is usually attributed to <a target="_blank" href="/en/peter-paul-rubens">Rubens</a>, showing his huge admiration for <a target="_blank" href="/en/leonardo-da-vinci">Leonardo da Vinci</a> and his The Battle of Anghiari, though the biographer Giovanni Pietro Bellori has attributed it to <a target="_blank" href="/en/anthony-van-dyck">Anthony van Dyck</a>. It is now in the Alte Pinakothek in Munich.
<br>
<br>This painting was formerly in the collection of Cornelis van der Geest and can be seen in two paintings of his art gallery in the 1630s by Willem van Haecht.</span>

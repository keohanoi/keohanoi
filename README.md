        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">Sound takes on a whole new dimension in Tinguely’s radio sculptures. It is no longer merely the motor or machine making noise; nor do the sounds come from the machine-driven striking of pots or drums. These are fully new, always up-to-the-minute original sounds produced by the radio. The world of communication and rapid news underpins the declamatory sculptures with their loudspeaker faces. Daily life is brought into the realm of art, not as a depiction, but rather dismembered into sentence or music fragments.</span>

        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">This composition of adhesive letters arranged between two sheets of acrylic is from a series by Mira Schendel that emphasized ambient light, transparency, and spatial relationships. The letters act as symbols, without reference to specific words or objects. The sensual and delicate quality of this work is typical of Schendel’s approach to geometric abstraction.</span>

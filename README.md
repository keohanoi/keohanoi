        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">Since 1989, Horn frequently has embedded texts in her sculptures. In this work, the top edges of letters can be seen on two sides of an aluminium slab. At first glance they resemble the calibrated forms of universal bar codes. When the viewer walks around the work the phrase 'to see a landscape as it is when I am not there' becomes legible. The line is from 'Gravity and Grace' by the French writer Simone Weil. Horn uses the phrase to remind us to look carefully at what we see, and to try to perceive the world without the filter of cultural preconceptions that may distort our vision.</span>

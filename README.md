        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">These lattices derive from the series of extendable panels begun before the 1970's. They are painted on both sides in a way that disturbs pictorial space and introduces a quasi-impressionist feeling. Daniel Dezeuze, who has always been in dialogue with the illusionistic space of the canvas, shifts the boundaries between painting and sculpture by using these lattices which have a regular pattern of lozenge shaped voids.</span>

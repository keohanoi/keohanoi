        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">El caballero de la mano en el pecho, variously translated into English as The Gentleman with His Hand at His Breast, Gentleman with his Hand on his Chest or The Nobleman with his Hand on his Chest, is an oil painting by <a target="_blank" href="/en/el-greco">El Greco</a>.
<br>
<br>Painted in Toledo around 1580, and on display at the Museo del Prado, it is the most famous of a series of secular portraits of unknown gentlemen, all of them dressed in black and wearing white ruffs, against dark backgrounds.
<br>
<br>Some authors suggest it may be a portrait of Juan de Silva y Ribera, 3rd Marquis of Montemayor and warden of the Alcazar of Toledo. The artist Rupert Shrive and the historian Alex Burghart have also argued that it may be a self-portrait.</span>

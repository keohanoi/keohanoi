        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">The subject of this painting was Modigliani’s longtime love and partner, Jeanne Hebuterne. The young woman renounced her family and her Roman Catholic background to be with the painter, and the couple soon had one daughter. After two years together, Modigliani died of the tuberculosis from which he suffered the majority of his life. Jeanne, grief-stricken and inconsolable, threw herself out of a fifth-floor window, killing herself and their unborn child. Complete with a long, thin frame and head cocked coyly to the side, the painting is done with such care and simple beauty that you can almost see Jeanne through Modigliani’s eyes. </span>

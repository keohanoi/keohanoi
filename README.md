        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">The bird figure Loplop was Ernst's alter ego. This painting shows not only the artist's fascination with mythology and the primitive as subject matter (as exemplified by the bird), but also his formal interest in attaching different materials to the canvas. Both of these impulses would prove vital to the work of Jackson Pollock. </span>

        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">This work has a sketch-like quality. The fluid composition, made up of spontaneous, expansive strokes, may reflect the freedom of flight. Although verging on abstraction, the evocative title brings to mind forms from the natural world. Black circles hint at the pupils of eyes, while a triangular form at the right reaches out like a wing. The overall impression is menacing, and the work may relate to Jorn’s interest in the mythology of his native Denmark.</span>

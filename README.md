        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">The Beaneater, a naturalistic genre painting by Carracci, depicts an everyday scene of Italian life. The artwork portrays a man eating a simple meal of beans, onions, bread, and wine. To convey a rustic feel, Carracci employed broken brushwork, deviating from the flat, polished finish preferred by fine artists during the late 16th century.<br><br>Carracci skillfully combined portraiture and still life in the composition, showcasing his ability to unite different elements in a single painting. This candid approach was unique during a time when monumental depictions of biblical figures and posed portraits of the wealthy dominated painting. The lack of composure and level perspective creates a similar effect to a photograph taken from across a table. The beaneater is captured in a spontaneous moment, with blushed cheeks and an open mouth indicating his direct engagement. Although the portrayal may seem unflattering, the level perspective places the viewer on the same social level as the subject, showcasing Carracci's sympathy for the simple daily routines of the working class. This humanistic strategy was innovative during the 16th century, where wealthy commissions dominated portraiture.</span>

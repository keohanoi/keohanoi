        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">Left unfinished at the time of his death, it is generally agreed that the landscape and sky in Sleeping Venus were completed by the Renaissance painter Titian. The choice of a single nude woman marked a revolution in art, as it was an unprecedented element, especially the semi-erotic positioning of the arms, one of which is raised, the other being placed near the groin. A further innovation in this painting is Giorgione’s use of a landscape to frame the sleeping goddess, as he was the first painter to widely paint landscapes with figures. The painting is now held in the Old Masters Picture Gallery in Dresden, Germany. </span>

        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">Dalet Kaf is an example of Louis' later Veils. Like the Unfurleds, they are poured from top to bottom, aided by gravity: to work within the small confines of his studio, Louis would staple canvas to the walls and pour paint from above. Here, the thin washes of paint slither across the surface of the canvas, the brighter colors muted by the "veil" of black that frames the composition. </span>

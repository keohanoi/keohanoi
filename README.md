        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">The Two Sisters is an 1843 oil painting on canvas by the French <a target="_blank" href="/en/artists-by-art-movement/romanticism">romantic</a> artist <a target="_blank" href="/en/theodore-chasseriau">Théodore Chassériau</a>. Completed when the artist was twenty-three years of age, it depicts Chassériau's sisters Adèle and Aline. It is housed in the Musée du Louvre in Paris, France.
<br>
<br>The work is a product of Chassériau's early maturity, when he was eager to demonstrate his independence form his former master, J.A.D. Ingres, with whom he had had a falling-out in 1840. When the painting was exhibited in the Salon of 1843, the response of the critics and the public was mixed. One critic, Louis Peisse, wrote:
<br>
<br>Although the representation of the identically dressed sisters suggests twinship, Adèle (on the left) was thirty-three and Aline (on the right) was twenty-one when they posed for the portrait.
<br>
<br>By the time of Chassériau's death in 1856, The Two Sisters was regarded as one of his most important works. It entered the collection of the Louvre in 1918.</span>

        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">In the part of the prologue that concerns the Church, Beatus follows mainly St Isidore and, to a lesser extent, St Gregory the Great, Tyconius and St Jerome. He provides a short treatise about ecclesiology designed to explain the meaning of Christ, the angels, patriarchs, prophets, apostles, martyrs, clergy, monks, religious and the faithful.

<br>This image, found in branch IIb alone, may perhaps have been an innovation by Maius included in one of the miniatures that has disappeared from the Tábara Beatus: it is exclusive to the extant, tenth-century Beatus and is only to be found again in the later Beatus, albeit in a different configuration having discarded the frieze layout . The provenance of the portrait of the apostles may be two-fold. On the one hand, the collections of biographies on papyrus scrolls were illustrated in Antiquity by portraits: a very widespread procedure. The representation of a figure or author of a text standing or in a medallion has ancient models. When Christians began to add portraits to different books of the Bible, they adapted the standing figure of the author used in Antiquity – the style most commonplace when the scroll was still in use – employing it frequently. As a result, the prophets appear in this pose in particular, sometimes holding the rolled-up scroll in their left hand – as in the famous statue of Democritus – or reading the unrolled scroll, as in the portrait of Euripides or Virgil. After the codex was invented, a trend developed of devoting entire pages to single miniatures and separating them from the text in the columns they were inserted into.</span>

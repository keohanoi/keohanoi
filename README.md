        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">The Bólides (or Fireballs) are a series of sculptural objects, which Oiticica referred to as ‘Trans-Objects’, in which colour is apparently ‘inflamed’ by light and therefore embodies energy. Originally designed to be handled, they frequently incorporate raw earth or pigment in powdered form and other inexpensive, everyday or organic materials such as shells. This large Box Bólide includes a series of drawers or panels which are pulled out to reveal their contents or the different colours in which they are painted.</span>

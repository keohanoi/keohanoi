        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">Millet considered this painting to be his masterpiece. This painting marked many milestones for the artist. He worked on this painting longer than any other painting. He also conceived the painting to rival the great works of Michelangelo and Poussin. This painting marked his departure of simple portrayals of peasant life to paintings that were more socially oriented. It was also the only painting that the artist dated. And last but not least, this was the only painting for which Millet ever won an award, in this case being the second place medal at the 1853 Paris Salon.</span>

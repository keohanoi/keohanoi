        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">Anna Ancher has painted her own studio in Anchers Hus in this picture, but it looks more like a living room without any indications that this is an artist’s working space: There is no easel, no paintbrushes and most importantly, no paintings. Instead, she has chosen to focus on the table and the arrangement of clematis flowers on the table, and the window framed by the light blue curtains. In 1913, the architect Ulrik Plesner designed an extension to Anchers Hus with studios for both Anna Ancher and her husband Michael Ancher. Anna Ancher probably painted this picture shortly after the completion of the extension. The painting gets its title from the clematis in the vase on the table. The clematis is of the Jackmanii variety, which still grows in the gardens at Anchers Hus and Skagens Museum.<br><br><a target="_blank" href="https://skagenskunstmuseer.dk/en/works/interior-with-clematis/

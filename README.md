        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">As sparkling streams of liquid royal blue flow effortlessly around and through one another, the layers of paint pull the viewers eye across the canvas and then down into its icy depths. Here the artist masterfully orchestrates color and form to produce a sensation of infinite space. This work calls up visions of blue seascapes of the French artist Paul Cézanne and Henri Matisse's predilection for blue, or even Yves Klein's fixation on blue. Igor S. refers to the Russian composer Igor Stravinsky and marks the occasion of his death in 1971. As Brooks' career went from strength to strength he continued to take risks, pushing the acrylic medium to its absolute limit.</span>

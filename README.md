        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">The Vision of the Blessed Hermann Joseph or The Mystical Engagement of the Blessed Hermann Joseph to the Virgin Mary is a 1629-30 painting by the Flemish Baroque painter <a target="_blank" href="/en/anthony-van-dyck">Anthony van Dyck</a>.
<br>
<br>The painting depicts Hermann Joseph, a Premonstratensian canon and priest from the Cologne region. He had a devotion to the Virgin Mary and according to legend had several visions of her during his lifetime - the painting shows one of these, in which he was joined in a mystic marriage to her and received the name 'Joseph' after her spouse Saint Joseph It is now in the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna.
<br>
<br>The painting was one of several commissioned from van Dyck by the Jesuit sodality in Antwerp, of which he had become a member in 1628. It seems to have been influenced by The Vision of Saint Francis Xavier by the Antwerp painter Gerard Seghers and by <a target="_blank" href="/en/peter-paul-rubens">Rubens</a>'s Saint Teresa of Ávila's Vision of the Holy Spirit - van Dyck had been working as Rubens' studio assistant and pupil since returning to Antwerp in 1627 after eight years in Italy, including work on a series of paintings for Saint Carolus Borromeus church.</span>

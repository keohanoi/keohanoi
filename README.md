Commonly identified as <i>Tlazolteotl</i>— the goddess of earth, sex, and childbirth in Aztec mythology—the stone carving provided the photographer with a captivating object embodying the Surrealists’ fascination with dualities and the grotesque. The anguish and tension conveyed by<br>her jutting jaw, teeth-baring grimace, and face grossly contorted in the agony of labor<br>belies her empty and expressionless gaze. Evoking conflicting responses of empathy<br>and revulsion as she gives birth to a misshapen creature, the crouching figure<br>presents incongruities appealing to Surrealist sensibilities. Indeed, this enigmatic<br>figure attracted an entourage of admirers among aficionados of pre-Columbian art<br>in the 1930s, André Breton foremost among them. He acquired a ceramic copy of<br>the coveted statuette that in spite of being a rather mediocre facsimile he nonetheless<br>added to his eclectic collection and retained until the end of his life.<br><br>Despite the <i>Tlazolteotl</i> figure’s status as one of the most exhibited, reproduced and celebrated objects of <a target="_blank" href="https://www.wikiart.org/en/aztec-art">Aztec art</a>, Man Ray’s photographic engagement with it has surprisingly escaped attention. This oversight<br>might be explained in part by the apparent absence of the image in any publication or exhibition, either at the time it was made or subsequently. The obscurity of this photograph nonetheless seems odd given that this highly unusual photomontage constructed from a series of related prints are in the collection of the Museum of Modern Art, where they have languished since they arrived in 1941 as part of a bequest from James Thrall Soby. While Man Ray’s <a target="_blank" href="https://www.wikiart.org/en/man-ray/black-and-white">photographs of African</a> and—to a lesser extent—<br>Oceanic art are attracting increasing critical interest, these images and his other<br>photographs of objects from indigenous peoples of the “New World” are virtually<br>unknown.<br><br><br><br></span>

        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">In this early Madonna and Child, painted in about 1460, Mantegna seems to be experimenting with a pictorial equivalent for the relief sculpture of Donatello, who worked at Padua in the 1440s. This painting in turn inspired the early Madonnas of Mantegna's brother-in-law, Giovanni Bellini.</span>

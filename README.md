It is an installation made by a sequence of defining moments, almost a decomposition of human life in linked scenes, inside a computable perimeter, which is suspended in a large vacuum of time, in a desperate solitude.<br>Here we are in the aftermath of a catastrophe, of a season in hell, walking the border of the abyss between a new fall and the beginning of a rise.<br><br>(ex Ospedale Militare, Napoli)</span>

        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">Krasner created Seated Nude right around the time she began to associate with the American Abstract artists, where she met her husband, Jackson Pollock. Showing remnants of Cubism, this charcoal shows Krasner experimenting with abstraction in a fashion both raw and evocative. </span>

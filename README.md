The board is made of a single plank of sycomore wood, with smaller pieces used to fill in the shoulders. It was plastered and then painted with colorful decoration on a white background. Gautsoshen wears a blue wig with decorative bands across the lower tresses, a fillet, and large round earrings. As is usual for the coffin of a female, she crosses her open hands over the broad collar that is draped around her shoulders and across her chest. The tips of her breasts, covered by round disks, are visible just below the bottom edge of her wig. The lower part of the coffin is divided into square sections containing religious scenes.<br><br><a target="_blank" href="https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/560983">The Met</a></span>

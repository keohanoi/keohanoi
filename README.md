        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">Hesse made drawings throughout her career. During 1964–1965 she was based in Germany as the guest of a textile manufacturer and collector who provided her with a studio space above his textile factory. Many of her drawings from this period, including this one, combine imagery which is principally abstract and organic with details that suggest machine parts and elements drawn from the factory environment.</span>

        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">According to Dante’s cosmology, this last chapter of the project <i>Seven Seasons of the Spirit</i> is the vertigo of the poet, a literary figure who is no longer able to tell what is beyond a certain height of heaven. Hence, in this work that can be considered the most visionary of the cycle, Gian Maria Tosatti attempts to give a hypothesis of it. Here, it becomes clear, that the task of man is to elevate himself towards a full awareness of the incredible height of the human spirit. Here it is a land to walk, the land of the last heaven, which is not a place for a beatitude that has to be relished, but a point of departure. Who reaches this place understands that their mission is to come back to testify the existence of that region of the spirit and to show the way.<br><br>(ex convento della Trinità delle Monache, Naples)</span>

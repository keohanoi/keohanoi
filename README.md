        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">Madonna del Parto, a fresco in the Museo della Madonna del Parto in Tuscany, was completed in only seven days. Francesca used only the best pigments, including a lapis lazuli pigment imported by the Republic of Venice from Afghanistan. The fresco was originally completed in the Santa Maria di Momentana church in the town of Monterchi, Tuscany, but it was broken off in an earthquake in 1785. The fresco was relocated to its current location in 1992. In the 20th century, the painting has been a source of inspiration for books, poems, and even a feature film. </span>

        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">As with all of Dali's work, there is a dream-like quality here. His image of Lazarus appeals to the fear of death and decay within all living creatures, but has an energy that speaks of life as well. Dali is known for his use of symbolism, but there is not much that is symbolic in this picture. It is more impressionistic, suggesting as it does both death and life in a single image.</span>

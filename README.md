        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">Portrait of a Young Woman is a painting which is commonly believed to be by the Italian Renaissance painter <a target="_blank" href="/en/sandro-botticelli">Sandro Botticelli</a>, executed between 1480 and 1485. Others attribute authorship to Jacopo da Sellaio. The woman is shown in profile but with her bust turned in three-quarter view to reveal a cameo medallion she is wearing round her neck. The medallion is a copy in reverse of "Nero's Seal", a famous antique carnelian representing Apollo and Marsyas, which belonged to Lorenzo de' Medici.
<br>
<br>It is housed in the Städel Museum of Frankfurt, Germany. Other similar Botticelli paintings are to be found in the National Gallery, London, the Gemäldegalerie, Berlin, and in the Marubeni Collection, Tokyo.
<br>
<br>David Alan Brown of the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C. describes the painting as of an ideally beautiful young woman mythologised as a nymph or goddess, a view reflected in the title given it by the Städel. It belongs to a group of such paintings by Botticelli or his workshop.
<br>
<br>The art historian Aby Warburg first suggested the painting was an idealised portrait of Simonetta Vespucci.
<br>
<br>It is suggested that Quattrocento paintings of hair and water are related, though it is uncertain which most informs the other.</span>

The painting depicts Honorius feeding birds which are on the rug in front of him; the dark colors of the rug and his clothes define a space. Separated from him and the birds are the councillors seeking his attention, and who along with the attendant are dressed in paler shades.

<br>The Favourites of the Emperor Honorius is part of the collection of the Art Gallery of South Australia, which also owns Waterhouse's Circe Invidiosa.</span>

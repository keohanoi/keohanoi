It is now in the private collection of the Duke of Westminster.
<br>
<br>It was produced at the height of his fame, while he was 'principal Paynter in order to their Majesties' at the court of Charles I of England, who also knighted him. He wears the gold chain given to him by Charles and holds a large sunflower, whose symbolism is much debated.</span>

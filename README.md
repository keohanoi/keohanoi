        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">This painting was one of a series of paintings featuring young girls. Although the model in this painting is unidentified, it may well have been Fragonard’s daughter, who frequently worked as one of his models. Contemporary x-rays have revealed that this painting, depicting a young girl in a sunshine yellow dress, deeply absorbed in her reading, was painted over a different image. As in many of Fragonard’s paintings the viewer gets the impression that he or she is witnessing a private moment, and is at once struck by the beauty and intimacy as well as the desire to give the girl her privacy and let her read. </span>

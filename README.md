        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">Sergei Eisentstein’s 1925 silent film the “Battleship Potemkin” was an influential work for Bacon, who was inspired by one particular image of the film as a catalyst for many of his works. The particular image is the screaming face of the nurse in the film. Her face is bloody and her glasses are crushed against the right side of her face, mouth frozen open in a silent scream of terror. Bacon saw the film for the first time in 1935, and thereafter kept a photographic still of the nurse’s screaming face as inspiration for his later works. </span>

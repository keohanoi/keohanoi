        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">Three Figures in a Room is a 1964 <a target="_blank" href="/en/paintings-by-media/oil-on-sacking">oil-on-canvas</a> triptych painting by British artist <a target="_blank" href="/en/francis-bacon">Francis Bacon</a>. Each panel measures 198&nbsp;×&nbsp;147 centimetres (78&nbsp;×&nbsp;58&nbsp;in) and shows a separate view of his lover <a target="_blank" href="/en/francis-bacon">George Dyer</a>, whom Bacon first met in 1963. It is the first of Bacon's works to feature Dyer, a model to whom he returned to repeatedly in his paintings. The work has been described as Bacon's first secular triptych.
<br>
<br>Bacon had been painting triptychs since his in 1944 break-through Three Studies for Figures at the Base of a Crucifixion. Three Figures continues the theme of Bacon studying a single subject from different angles. Although painted on three separate canvases, each image occupies the same space, marked by a brown elliptical floor and yellowish walls which continue across the panels. The presence of a single model three times in the same space defies narrative explanation.
<br>
<br>Dyer is depicted in three different positions, all twisted and contorted. Bacon uses large and vigorous brushstrokes to create distinctive splashes of colour. In the left panel, a naked Dyer sits on a toilet facing away from the viewer; he rests on a massive black bed or chair in the centre panel; and he is sitting contorted on a pedestal chair in the right panel. The creased back of the left figure may be inspired by <a target="_blank" href="/en/edgar-degas">Edgar Degas</a>'s drawing After the Bath, Woman drying herself, and also possibly by the Belvedere Torso. Art critic David Sylvester has suggested that the centre and right figures may be inspired by <a target="_blank" href="/en/michelangelo">Michelangelo</a>'s sculptures in the Medici Chapel, and draws parallels with the three figures in <a target="_blank" href="/en/henri-matisse">Henri Matisse</a>'s Bathers with a Turtle.
<br>
<br>The work was bought by the French state in 1968 and has been part of the collection of the Centre Georges Pompidou since 1976.</span>

He only spent a day at Windham College in Vermont. Using a map, he drew a pentagon with the campus as its centre and then proceeded to collect earth from the locations that correspond to its five points. Mixed with resin, the samples were shown at Windham College with documentary materials. After the exhibition, they were reburied on campus.</span>

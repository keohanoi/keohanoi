        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">In 2005, performance artist Marina Abramovic shot a series of seven videos depicting ancient rituals from her birthplace, the Balkans; this one re-enacts mystical rites related to fertility and virility. From medieval times to the 18th century, men and women from small villages believed they could use their sex organs as tools to improve their lives, to reach the gods: copulating with the earth to boost the crops, for example, or showing their genitals to the sky to scare the demons that caused storms. Interspersed throughout are reflections from the artist on the genesis and production of the project. Written by Richard C. Haber</span>

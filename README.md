        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">The Portrait of Bernhart von Reesen is a painting by German Renaissance master <a target="_blank" href="/en/albrecht-durer">Albrecht Dürer</a>, dating from 1521, now housed in the Gemäldegalerie Alte Meister of Dresden, Germany.
<br>
<br>The painting was executed during the artist's trip to the Low Countries (1520–1521). On 16 March 1521, Dürer wrote that he had portrayed in Antwerp one Bernhart von Reesen, being paid eight florins and some small gifts for his wife and maid. The subject is unknown, although he could be one rich merchant from Danzig who was active in the cosmopolitan Flemish port. Other scholars identify him with Bernard van Orley, a painter from Brussels.
<br>
<br>The man is portrayed with black garments, aside from the white shirt under the jacket. His hands, which, according to the Flemish painting tradition, are lying on the lower border, hold a cartouche where it is perhaps written his address.</span>

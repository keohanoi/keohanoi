In the background, two clerks whisper behind a screen. The artist has paid significant attention to capturing the detail of the scene, even including the Liverpool Almanack and Table stuck on the wall.
<br>
<br>Campbell's own father worked for the Sun Insurance Company in Liverpool and the artist was no doubt familiar with the warren of clerk's offices in Liverpool's city centre.</span>

        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">Saint Catherine of Alexandria is a painting by the Italian Renaissance artist <a target="_blank" href="/en/raphael">Raphael</a>. In the painting, Catherine of Alexandria is looking upward in ecstasy and leaning on a wheel - an allusion to the breaking wheel (or Catherine wheel) of her martyrdom.
<br>
<br>It was painted c. 1507, towards the end of Raphael's sojourn in Florence and shows the young artist in a transitional phase. The depiction of religious passion in the painting is still reminiscent of <a target="_blank" href="/en/pietro-perugino">Pietro Perugino</a>. But the graceful contrapposto of Catherine's pose is typical of the influence of <a target="_blank" href="/en/leonardo-da-vinci">Leonardo da Vinci</a> on Raphael, and is believed to be an echo of Leonardo's lost painting Leda and the Swan.
<br>
<br>Raphael employed the usual Renaissance pigments such as natural ultramarine, madder lake, ochres and lead-tin yellow. He also mixed a special kind of finely powdered glass into several pigments to speed up the drying of the oil paints.
<br>
<br>This picture was partially used on the cover of The Smashing Pumpkins album Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness.</span>

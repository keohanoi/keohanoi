        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">Mrs Sargent was about to get married when she sat for Romney for this portrait. On the table is a marble relief of a wedding scene, The Marriage of Cupid and Psyche. The other objects on the table demonstrate her character and interests. The statuette of Minerva, Goddess of Wisdom, suggests she is wise; the drawing instrument tells us she is artistic and the book shows her learning.

<br>Romney painted the picture not long after his return from Rome, where he had studied classical sculpture. His works became very fashionable again in the late 19th century.</span>

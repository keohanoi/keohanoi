        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">Ann Verelst was born in 1751. She was the youngest daughter of Josias Wordsworth of Wadworth Hall near Doncaster.
<br>
<br>In 1771 she married Harry Verelst, (a former Governor of Bengal) and moved into his house, Aston Hall, near Rotherham. This portrait was painted in 1771 or 1772 and is likely to have been commissioned to celebrate their marriage. George Romney was the son of a furniture maker from Dalton in Furness, Lancashire. At the age of 21 he was apprenticed to the portrait painter Christopher Steele. In the 1760s Romney moved to London and went on to become a fashionable portrait painter.</span>

        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">This painting was made after the dispersal of the CoBrA group, but it demonstrates the artist's continuing commitment to the ideals of expressive, spontaneous painting. Appel worked with the paint at high speed and with no preconceived scheme, turning the large canvas around from time to time. The figurative elements were added last. Their appearance recalls the naivety of paintings made by children, whose untrained and unadulterated approach was much admired by CoBrA artists.</span>

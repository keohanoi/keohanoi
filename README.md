        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">Le Boulevard de Montmartre, Matinée de Printemps is an 1897 oil on canvas painting of Paris' Boulevard Montmartre by the French artist <a target="_blank" href="/en/camille-pissarro">Camille Pissarro</a>.
<br>
<br>By 1923 it was in the collection of the German industrialist and Holocaust victim Max Silberberg (de). Silberberg was obliged by the ruling Nazi regime to dispose of the work in a forced sale in 1935. It was restituted to his family in 2000 and placed on loan with the Israel Museum until 2013. On 5 February 2014 it was auctioned at Sotheby's, London, for £19,682,500, double its pre-sale estimate.</span>

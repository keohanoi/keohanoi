        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">Rembrandt painted his wife Saskia van Uylenburgh as Flora, goddess of spring and flowers, three times: in 1634,1635 and 1641. In this work he combined elements of pastoral and historical portraits. Created in the year of their marriage, this painting shows the love and admiration the artist felt for the young woman. The contrast between the young sitter's diffident pose and the sumptuousness of her richly embroidered clothes and accessories gives the image a special charm. </span>

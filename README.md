        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">By 1923 Mackintosh had decided to abandon architecture and design and move to the South of France. There he produced a small group of flower paintings and studies of ships in port. However the main focus in his painting was the interaction of the man-made and natural landscapes. Mackintosh's late watercolours share the static discipline of their compositions, which are rarely inhabited by people. This is a depiction of the bay at Port Vendres, the Mackintoshes' winter base.</span>

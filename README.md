It is preserved in the Alexandros Soutzos Museum.
<br>
<br>It belongs to the Roman period of El Greco. The scene takes place in a cave, where the figures are silhouetted against a dark background and craggy rocks. A character back introduces the public to the composition, a <a target="_blank" href="/en/artists-by-art-movement/mannerism-late-renaissance">mannerist</a> style. the strong influence of <a target="_blank" href="/en/michelangelo">Michelangelo</a> is seen in the face of Christ to the apostles.
<br>
<br>El Greco manages to convey the feelings of sadness and desolation of the holy women. His ability as a portraitist is demonstrated by playing with sienna and blue hues.</span>

        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">It was Schwitters’ practice to incorporate chance into his works, by using found materials in which he identified subtlety and beauty. In his final years, spent in exile in Britain, he made small scale works with wood, plaster and other elements. Many of these were informal, but often use coloured and painted surfaces to resolve the composition. The results are curious, often witty, sculptures.</span>

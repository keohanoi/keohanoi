        <span class="artwork-description-text ng-binding" ng-bind-html="viewModel.ArtworkOfTheDay.Description | unsafe">Monet’s Water Lilies series contained around 250 paintings, which he painted during the last thirty years of his life at his house in Giverny, France. Many of the paintings were completed while Monet was suffering from cataracts, which gave him a redder tone to his vision, which is represented in some of his paintings. He went through two surgeries in 1923 to remove his cataracts, which many have left his eyes more sensitive to ultraviolet wavelengths, as he went back and repainted some of his water lilies with a bluer tone. Works from Monet’s Water Lilies series are now housed all over the world, and have sold at auction for almost $41 million. </span>
